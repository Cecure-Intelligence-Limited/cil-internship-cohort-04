## **CLOUD SERVICE PROVIDERS**

Cloud service providers offer on-demand infrastructure and tools for developers, start-ups, small- & medium-sized businesses, and large enterprises to build, deploy, and scale their software applications and databases.

The two main markets which cloud service providers operate in are the Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), which are comprised of the following:
- Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS): compute, storage, and networking
- Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS): database management systems and application platforms

With this combined IaaS and PaaS infrastructure, cloud service providers enable a wide range of use cases, including ***web & mobile applications, website hosting, e-commerce, media & gaming, managed services,*** among many more.

These computing and storage services rely on shared servers which offer a high degree of scalability and continuity. Typically, customers consume cloud computing services on a pay-per-use basis.

Additionally, certain public cloud service providers offer **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS),** which refers to ***end user applications.***

### **Digital Infrastructure**

Cloud service providers build their digital infrastructure around what are known as **regions and availability zones.** A region is a physical location in the world where a cloud service provider has multiple availability zones. These availability zones consist of one or more isolated data centers, that are housed in separate buildings, each with redundant power, cooling, networking, and fiber-optic connectivity.

Availability zones enable end users to operate production applications and databases that are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than is possible from an individual data center.

Cloud computing and the cloud service providers delivering these services, have brought fundamental changes to the market backdrop of IT infrastructure globally. Public cloud service providers are facilitating the inherent efficiencies of distributed cloud computing, which is enabling innovative software applications and platforms to be built, while simultaneously enhancing information security and privacy controls. As such, it is critical to understand each leading cloud service provider, as well as their varying strategies.

As a whole, the ten biggest cloud service providers globally in 2022 are ***Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Alibaba Cloud, Oracle Cloud, IBM Cloud (Kyndryl), Tencent Cloud, OVHcloud, DigitalOcean, and Linode (owned by Akamai).***

## **The Smaller Cloud Service Providers**

While the top 10 cloud service providers capture ~77% of spending on cloud infrastructure services, there is still a significant number of small vendors present in global markets. For example, these cloud service providers include those targeting a certain niche, such as **small- & medium-sized businesses (SMBs)** or ones that operate regionally, such as in Europe or Asia Pacific.

Below are examples of these 'small' cloud service providers:
- **China:**

    -  Baidu AI Cloud
    - Huawei Cloud
    - Kingsoft Cloud
    - JD Cloud
    - QingCloud
    - UCloud
- **Europe:** 

    - Bleu (Orange and Capgemini)
    - Hetzner
    - Leaseweb
- **Japan and Korea:**

    - Fujitsu
    - NTT
    - SoftBank
    - NAVER Cloud
    - KT Cloud
- **Private Cloud / Managed Services:**

    - Hewlett Packard Enterprise
    - Rackspace
    - VMware
- **SaaS Partners:**

    - Salesforce
    - SAP
- **SMBs:**

    - Heroku
    - UpCloud
    - Vultr

Within the cloud service provider market, there is an important distinction to make for ***managed services providers*** like Rackspace.

Managed services providers help enterprises **migrate, architect, and deploy workloads to the public cloud.** Subsequently, these managed services providers ‘manage’ the IT infrastructure for their customers across multiple environments, including public cloud, private cloud, and on-premises.

Through this business model, the cloud service providers still remain as the ultimate owners and providers of IT infrastructure.
