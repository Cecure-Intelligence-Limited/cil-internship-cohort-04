## **CLOUD DEPLOYMENT MODELS**
In cloud computing, we have access to a shared pool of computer resources (servers, storage, programs, and so on) in the cloud.

The utilization of the cloud has changed over the years now. Earlier, it was just an extraordinary option but today it has become a necessity. Today, cloud services come with various deployment models. Generally, when we talk about cloud and cloud services, we think of “public cloud” since it is the most popular cloud model out there. That is just one of the cloud deployments models where the provider owns and maintains all the servers and other hardware resources.

### **What is Cloud Deployment Model?**
A cloud deployment model refers to an arrangement of specific environment variables like accessibility and ownership of the distributing framework and storage size. There are various types of deployment models based on the location and who manages the infrastructure. 

### **The Need for Different Cloud Deployment Models**
At times companies manage their data centers with older features. It is not possible to move to the public cloud for many reasons, it could be to avoid compromising on compliance and data protection laws or they might just be unsure about moving to the public cloud because they would have spent loads of money on their own servers and they would want to utilize them. To decide which cloud deployment model suits their organization, it is important to have a thorough understanding of all 5 cloud deployment models.

There are 5 popular cloud deployment models. **Public, Private, Hybrid, Community** and **Multi-cloud Models**. Three of these are discussed below.

## **Public Cloud**

The public cloud deployment model is the most popular one. In a public cloud deployment model, you do not own any hardware, since all the resources are provided by the cloud service provider. It is available for the general public and the resources can be used by all. The data is generated and stored by third-party service providers which means companies need not maintain their hardware.

The public cloud deployment model works well with companies with little privacy concerns.

***Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), AWS (Amazon Web Services), Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, Google Cloud, Salesforce and Heroku*** are a few examples of companies with public cloud deployments offerings.

### **Benefits of a Public Cloud Model**
- Better infrastructure management
- Increased scalability
- Lower costs
- 24/7 operation time

### **Drawbacks of a Public Cloud Model**
- Security and privacy are a concern
- Lack of customized service
- Efficiency is not optimum

## **Private Cloud**
From a technical perspective, there is not much difference between the public and private deployment models since their architecture is similar. But in a private cloud deployment model, a dedicated environment is present for every customer. There is no sharing of hardware with any other users. Hence it is also called **‘internal’ or ‘corporate model’.**

In private cloud model, you maintain the data center just like it is done in public cloud model. An abstraction layer is created on top of your physical servers to gain flexibility. New servers can be added to the data center and there is no need to configure them again as they have semi-automatically become a part of the cluster. It is possible to get a private cloud from a public cloud provider.

***Red Hat OpenStack, CISCO, DELL, Rackspace, IBM Bluemix Private Cloud, Microsoft Azure Stack, and VMware Private Cloud*** are some of the examples of companies with a private cloud offering.

### **Benefits of a Private Cloud**
- High scalability
- Customization based on customer requirements
- High reliability, security and privacy.

### **Drawbacks of a Private Cloud**
- It is expensive as you need to pay for hardware, software, and training resources.

## **Hybrid cloud**

A hybrid cloud model is a combination of public and private cloud. It is the second most popular model after the public cloud model as it **combines** the best of public and private cloud features.

In a hybrid model, companies can use their existing public cloud and also own on-premises systems. This model is extremely useful during a seamless transition between clouds over a period of time.

Owing to security concerns, few companies cannot operate only in the public cloud. Hence, they go for a hybrid cloud to combine their needs and leverage benefits from a public cloud. Here, critical applications with sensitive data are run on premises and the rest of the applications are in the public cloud.

***Microsoft, Amazon, NetApp, Cisco, Google*** are some of the examples of compannies with a hybrid cloud model offering.

### **Benefits of Hybrid Cloud**
- Better security and privacy
- Improved scalability
- Cost-effective
- Simplifies data and application portability

### **Drawbacks of Hybrid Cloud**
- Cost: If you are using a hybrid cloud, you can fall into the trap of spending too much. Hybrid clouds are not inherently more expensive than any of the other types that we have looked at. But there is certainly a risk of spending too much if you are not careful about selecting the right services.
- Data Silos: If you are using a combination of public and private services, you have to make sure that all of your data has been properly separated. This can increase the security, compliance and auditing requirements of your business.
