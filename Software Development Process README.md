# 1. Describe what you understand by Scrum and elaborate on some of its benefits in software development.

Scrum is an agile framework for addressing complex adaptive problems while producing high-value products in a productive and creative manner. Scrum is a light weight that assists individuals, teams, organizations in creating value by providing adaptive solutions to complex problems.

Scrum necessitates the presence of a Scrum Master in order to folster an environment in which:

4. **Reduced risk** - Scrum focuses on a predictable, sustainanble delivery space and consistent feedback that give teams a chance to mitigate risks early and often. Short sprints let teams fail fast if an idea doesn't work, keeping the risk of failure manageable.

5. **Reduced time to market** - Scrum aims to deliver products and features in predictable increments through the use well defined sprints. it is not necessary to complete the entire product before releasing features. 

6. **Increased ROI** - The combined beenfit of Scrum result in a higher ROI. Constant feedback results in fewer costly mistakes later in the process as well as a better product with fewer defects. Reduced time to market and incremental releases increase revenue more quickly.
