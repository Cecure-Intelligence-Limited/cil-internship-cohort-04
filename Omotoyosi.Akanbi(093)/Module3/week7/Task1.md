# The digital product I use every day is Youtube.

## Why Youtube
Because Youtube is a free video sharing website or video search engine that I use to search for the necessary information I need for work and learning. Also I use youtube to watch different things like tutorials, movies, music videos, etc. I use Youtube to streamline events that I canâ€™t be physically present. 

### Youtube Features that can be Improved by and How it can be Improved 
- Video Suggestion features: The feature uses an algorithm that makes use of the history of the user on Youtube, and also rate the likes and dislikes of previous videos by the users to suggest videos for them.

  The algorithm can be made better to check the time of engagement used on each video before making suggestions. The algorithm can also be trained to check the hours, minutes, seconds user uses on each video before making suggestions. The top suggestion can be the ones the user spent hours watching, which shows the user has special interest in that kind of video. Survey shows that many suggested videos are already disliked by the user.

  If possible the algorithm can access the users browser history i.e the interest of the users, what exactly is there interest on the internet.

- Comment Feature: Many users want to reach out to the authors of the content directly instead of only the comment section under the content.

Send message button should be added to videos pages ( where logged viewers can  send messages to video creators directly ).

- Youtube Ads:  Users can add ads to their YouTube Channel, but these ads come from AdSense and similar online marketing companies.

  YouTube itself can have their own ads that appear on videos automatically and allow users to earn from their videos.
These ads should also be available even for small channels that are just starting. This way everyone has the chance to earn money.
