# Describe the Service Models and talk about cases where they are used... Give 5 samples for each of the models


## 1. SaaS -
Software as a service (SaaS) is a software distribution model in which a cloud provider hosts applications and makes them available to end users over the internet.

### How does SaaS work?
SaaS works through the cloud delivery model. A software provider will either host the application and related data using its own servers, databases, networking and computing resources, or it may be an ISV that contracts a cloud provider to host the application in the provider's data center. The application will be accessible to any device with a network connection. SaaS applications are typically accessed via web browsers.

### What are the advantages of SaaS?
- Accessibility: Ability to run via an internet browser 24/7 from any device.
- Operational Management: No installation, equipment updates or traditional licensing management.
- Cost Effective: No upfront hardware costs and flexible payment methods such as pay-as-you-go models.
- Scalability: Easily scale a solution to accommodate changing needs.
- Data Storage: Data is routinely saved in the cloud.
- Analytics: Access to data reporting and intelligence tools.
- Increase Security: SaaS providers invest heavily in security technology and expertise.

### What are the disadvantages of SaaS?
- Loss of Control: The vendor manages everything, making you dependent upon the vendor’s capabilities.
- Limited Customization: Most SaaS applications offer little in the way of customization from the vendor.
- Slower Speed: SaaS solutions can have more latency than client/server apps.
- Security Risks: While the SaaS provider secures the application itself, strict measures should be taken with sensitive data.

### SaaS solutions are beneficial in a variety of business scenarios:

- Startups and small businesses will find SaaS handy when they don’t have the time, capital or expertise to build their own applications or host applications on-premises.

- Larger companies may use SaaS technology for short-term projects or applications that aren’t needed all year long.

- Any company can benefit from SaaS technology when dealing with applications that require both web and mobile access.

### Examples of SaaS:
- Google Apps
- Salesforce
- Dropbox
- ZenDesk
- Slack



## 2. PaaS -
Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) is a cloud service delivery model where a third-party cloud service provider delivers some hardware and software tools, often those needed for application hosting or development, to customers over the internet.

### How does PaaS work?
PaaS works by delivering all standard development tools in an online interface; instead of working solely from your work computer on site, it’s possible to log-in from anywhere to collaborate on projects, test new applications, or roll-out completed products.

### What are the advantages of PaaS?
- Reduced Costs: Maintaining a physical development infrastructure can be a big commitment. From the IT staff needed to maintain applications to the costly server space, a traditional environment is expensive. PaaS alleviates most of these costs, offering a more affordable alternative.

- Improved Time to Market: PaaS platforms often offer more options than a standard development environment can. When this includes automated tools and easier testing, it’s possible to release products to market on an accelerated timeline.

- Scalability: If your company is growing, it’s likely your development needs will change. It can be hard to properly update a physical environment, but PaaS solutions can grow with you, accommodating the evolving state of your business.

- Regular Updates: Software updates can be a burden, particularly when they need to be rolled out among individual machines. Most PaaS models offer regular and automatic updates, ensuring everyone is always using the most current tools for development.

- Flexibility: Rather than being tethered to a single machine or network, PaaS makes it possible to develop on the go, even when away from the office. PaaS virtual machines are available anywhere, at any time, meaning that developers can do more than ever before.

### What are the disadvantages of PaaS?
- PaaS Provider Dependence: When using third-party architecture, as most PaaS solutions require, there’s a certain reliance on a PaaS vendor that can be challenging for those who like holding the reins. If something changes or service isn’t reliable, there’s little that can be done. Further, seeking help for issues means reaching out to an off-site help desk rather than turning to an in-house IT professional.

- Compatibility Challenges: For those who rely on other tools outside of the PaaS environment, compatibility can be an important. Before choosing a PaaS model, confirm that your selection complements the other resources you currently use or plan to use in the future.

- Lack of Customization: While plenty of PaaS products allow for ways to make an environment specific to a company’s own needs, there are limitations. Not all companies require extensive functionality that may be unique to in-house projects, but some do. Before moving forward with a PaaS product, companies are encouraged to evaluate their current platform and any peculiarities that could affect the transition process.

- Security Risks: When managing security in house, it’s possible to manage security in any manner desired. However, using a third-party means trusting that their tools are adequate to support your needs. 

### PaaS solutions are beneficial in a variety of business scenarios:

- organizations will find paas helpful because it can be used to automate backend processes and provides the necessary building blocks to respond to demand.
- PaaS is useful for companies that develop, run, and manage app programming interfaces and microservices. This also goes for the development of new APIs and end-to-end API management.
- PaaS is suitable for setting up and managing an organization’s database. PaaS provides a scalable, secure, and on-demand platform for creating, administering, and maintaining databases. As research firm Forrester puts it: “The shift to the cloud for big data is on.”

### Examples of PaaS:
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- OpenShift
- Heroku
- Google App Engine
- Apache Stratos



## 3. IaaS -
Infrastructure-as-a-Service, commonly referred to as simply “IaaS,” is a form of cloud computing that delivers fundamental compute, network, and storage resources to consumers on-demand, over the internet, and on a pay-as-you-go basis.

### How does IaaS work?
IaaS works in a way that it identifies a virtual or physical infrastructure available at a cloud provider. It links the customer to the cloud provider and offers several services such as virtualization, network.
The organization identifies its need and requests the appropriate service. The user then pays for the resource and IaaS also offers billing management services.

### What are the advantages of IaaS?
- Data security: IaaS is one of the most secure cloud computing methods. Users are therefore assured of data security.

- High Scalability: IaaS ensures that its products are always accessible by the users when needed. They can also be remodeled as per need.

- Highly flexible and redundant: even in the event hardware fails, the organization’s service paid for is not affected. Normalcy is achieved soonest.

- Constant availability: IaaS cloud computing platform is ever available to its users. Its products are available to users at any given time throughout the year.

- Flexibility: Rather than being tethered to a single machine or network, IaaS makes it possible to develop on the go, even when away from the office. IaaS virtual machines are available anywhere, at any time, meaning that developers can do more than ever before.

### What are the disadvantages of IaaS?
- Security
- Lack of flexibility
- Technical problems
- Over Dependency
- Upgrade & Maintenance
- Virtualization Services & User-Privacy


### IaaS solutions are beneficial in a variety of business scenarios:
IaaS is applicable in many circumstances. IaaS can be used in business organizations and large institutions.

- Businesses can use IaaS providers to scale their IT infrastructure. From a third-party provider, they can have a pool of virtual resources that they can use to host websites.

- In an organization, IaaS can be used to create and test new workloads. Before the organization develops s new application, they can always test it using the IaaS platform. Iaas will determine if it’s viable and then the organization can decide to install it on their premise.

- Disaster Recovery or Backup Solutions: Building centralized file storage and backup option for many users is a very complicated task that can be performed in a few steps with Infrastructure as a Service.

- Program Testing and Development: Software firms can benefit considerably from the scalability of an IaaS solution. With just a small amount of work, the testing and development environments can be set up and scaled again.

- Hosting Complex Websites: While IaaS is not always appropriate for simple websites, it can be the optimal basis for more complex web projects. Particularly for sites with profoundly fluctuating traffic.

- High Computing Performance: Encountering complex tasks including several million variables or calculations usually entails the use of supercomputers or clusters. Here, IaaS can be a better alternative because of its scalability.

- Big Data Analysis: IaaS can manage, store and analyze big data because it can handle large workloads and can incorporate with business intelligence tools. This helps get business insights, with which users can build relations with their clients and predict current trends.

### Examples of IaaS:
- Microsoft Azure
- Amazon Web Services
- Google Cloud Infrastructure
- Digital Ocean
- Linode
