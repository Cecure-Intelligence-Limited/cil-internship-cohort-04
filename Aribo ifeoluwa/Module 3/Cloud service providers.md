# Talk about the different cloud service providers and their offerings...
## Who is a Cloud service provider?
A cloud service provider is a third-party company offering a cloud-based platform, infrastructure, application, or storage services.


## Different examples of cloud service providers.


## 1. AMAZON WEB SERVICE (AWS):
AWS is a subsidiary of Amazon.com, the largest online retailer in the world. AWS provides cloud computing services to individuals, companies, and governments. In addition, it offers a set of remote computing services, including hosting and storage space on its servers, access to these resources through the internet, tools for managing them, and a range of other features that make it easier to build large-scale web applications. AWS is more than just an infrastructure service provider (ISP). It offers additional services such as analytics, database management, and security technologies that developers can use with its primary infrastructure offerings. The combination allows developers to focus on building their products. At the same time, AWS manages servers/hardware/networking, etc., and ensures they are secure from cyber attacks or hacker intrusions.

###  Examples of Services offered by AWS:
There are over 100 services offered by aws but we'd talk about a few.

- Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2): The Amazon EC2 service comes under the compute domain and it provides services that help to compute workloads. Amazon EC2 web interface is used to reduce the expensive physical servers by creating virtual machines. Also, they help in managing different features of the virtual servers such as security, ports, and storage. Amazon EC2 is highly preferable while creating a virtual server within a few minutes with just a few clicks according to the user’s operating system conveniently. It offers resizable compute capacity in the cloud. This helps a lot to focus more on the project rather than the server maintenance.

- Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): Amazon S3 is categorized under storage domain that provides data storage over the Internet services. Primarily, S3 stores data over the cloud in the form of objects. Amazon S3 stores the data with high security because of its improved infrastructure. The information is distributed over different physical regions and has a high-quality integration. This prevents the data from getting lost and helps to retrieve stored data irrespective of time and space via the Internet. Amazon S3 is highly available so that users can access their data just by one click with minimum or zero retrieving time.

- Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): Amazon VPC falls under the Networking domain of AWS which is used to isolate the network infrastructure of user’s computer. Every Amazon account holds a unique virtual network that protects the information from being accessed by others. These networks are logically isolated from other virtual networks in AWS clouds. This makes the user information risk-free in the AWS cloud.

- Amazon CloudFront: Amazon CloudFront represents the delivery domain that is used to deliver the content with great speed and reduced latency. Amazon CloudFront is used to connect with other AWS services and to help the developers to send the content to the end-users in a seamless manner. AWS CloudFront is managing all the users content in an effective manner via the Global Content Delivery Service.

- Amazon Relational Database Services (RDS): Amazon RDS comes under the Database domain of Amazon Web Services and is used to handle database related workloads. The RDS helps the users to design and manage the relational database in the cloud which stores the complex data of the infrastructure. Earlier RDs used to support MySQL and now it also supports Oracle, Microsoft SQL, and MariaDB. It reduces the operational costs and leverages the database server from maintenance and support.




## 2. Google Cloud Platform (GCP): 
Google Cloud Platform provides cloud computing services, including data storage, analytics, machine learning, and application development. It supports code development in various languages such as Java and Python.
Google Cloud Platform also supports open source technologies like Docker container management system, Apache Spark for batch processing, and Hadoop for distributed data processing. In addition, it also offers a range of managed services such as Google BigQuery for analytics or Google Cloud Search to index files stored in its storage area.

### Examples of Services offered by GCP:

#### Compute 
- App Engine: App Engine enables you to build and host applications on the same systems that power Google applications. App Engine offers fast development and deployment; simple administration, with no need to worry about hardware, patches or backups; and effortless scalability.
- Batch: Batch is a fully-managed service that allows you to create batch jobs at scale. The service dynamically provisions certain Google Cloud resources, schedules your batch job on the resources, manages the queue for the job, and executes the job. Batch is natively integrated with Google Cloud services for storage, logging, monitoring, and more. 

#### Storage 
- Cloud Storage: Cloud Storage is a RESTful service for storing and accessing your data on Google's infrastructure. The service combines the performance and scalability of Google's cloud with advanced security and sharing capabilities.
- Cloud Storage for Firebase: Cloud Storage for Firebase adds customizable Google security (via Firebase Security Rules for Cloud Storage) to file uploads and downloads for your Firebase apps, as well as robust uploads and downloads regardless of network quality through the Firebase SDK. Cloud Storage for Firebase is backed by Cloud Storage, a service for storing and accessing your data on Google's infrastructure.

#### Databases
- Datastore: Datastore is a fully-managed, schemaless, non-relational datastore. It provides a rich set of query capabilities, supports atomic transactions, and automatically scales up and down in response to load. It can scale to support an application with 1,000 users or 10 million users with no code changes.
- Firestore: Firestore is a NoSQL document database for storing, syncing, and querying data for mobile and web apps. Its client libraries provide live synchronization and offline support, while its security features and integrations with Firebase and Google Cloud Platform accelerate building serverless apps.
- Memorystore: Memorystore, which includes Memorystore for Redis and Memorystore for Memcached, provides a fully-managed in-memory data store service that allows customers to deploy distributed caches that provide sub-millisecond data access.

#### Networking
- Cloud CDN: Cloud CDN uses Google's globally distributed edge points of presence to cache HTTP(S) load balanced content close to your users.
- Cloud DNS: Cloud DNS is a high performance, resilient, global, fully-managed DNS service that provides a RESTful API to publish and manage DNS records for your applications and services.
- Cloud Interconnect: Cloud Interconnect offers enterprise-grade connections to Google Cloud Platform using Google Services for Dedicated Interconnect, Partner Interconnect and Cloud VPN. This solution allows you to directly connect your on-premises network to your Virtual Private Cloud.




## 3. IBM CLOUD: 
IBM cloud computing is a set of cloud computing services for business offered by the information technology company IBM. IBM Cloud includes infrastructure as a service (IaaS), software as a service (SaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) offered through public, private and hybrid cloud delivery models.
