## **CLOUD SERVICE MODELS**

**The various computing service are as follows:**
## 1. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
## 2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
## 3. Software as a Service (SaaS)

<br>

## **IAAS (Infrastructure as a service)** 
<p>
IaaS is also known as Hardware as a Service (HaaS). It is a computing infrastructure managed over the internet. The main advantage of using IaaS is that it helps users to avoid the high cost and complexity of purchasing and managing the physical servers. There is a shared responsibility between the service providers and users.</p>

It works very similarly to the traditional computer hardware (via operating systems, networks, servers, etc.), the only difference is that it operates virtually.

IaaS customers access resources and services through a wide area network (WAN), such as the internet, and can use the cloud provider's services to install the remaining elements of an application stack. For example, the user can log in to the IaaS platform to create virtual machines (VMs); install operating systems in each VM; deploy middleware, such as databases; create storage buckets for workloads and backups; and install the enterprise workload into that VM. Customers can then use the provider's services to track costs, monitor performance, balance network traffic, troubleshoot application issues and manage disaster recovery.

IaaS forms one of the three fundamental models of cloud service network OS. Whenever a user purchases software, server, cloud space, network equipment, and more, the IaaS provider rents those resources in the form of fully outsourced service (as a demand model). IaaS supports dynamic scaling and distributes its resources as a service. It thus, generally, allows multiple users on one piece of hardware.

There are various types of IaaS offered by different cloud computing providers like GCP, AZURE, AWS, ORACLE etc.

Example of these services include: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Windows Azure, Heroku, Force.com, Google App Engine, Apache Stratos, Magento Commerce Cloud, OpenShift, S3, EC2, Lambda by AWS, Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, Virtual Private Cloud all By Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Azure VM and
Azure disk storage offered by Microsoft Azure.

## Characteristics of IaaS
- Resources are available as a service
- Services are highly scalable
- Dynamic and flexible
- GUI and API-based access
- Automated administrative tasks

### **USE CASES**
IaaS can be used for a broad variety of purposes. Compute resources that it delivers through a cloud model can be used to fit a variety of use cases. The most common use cases for IaaS deployments include the following:

**Testing and development environments:** IaaS offers organizations flexibility when it comes to different test and development environments. They can easily be scaled up or down according to needs.

**Hosting customer-facing websites:** This can make it more affordable to host a website, compared to traditional means of hosting websites.

**Data storage, backup and recovery:** IaaS can be the easiest and most efficient way for organizations to manage data when demand is unpredictable or might steadily increase. Furthermore, organizations can circumvent the need for extensive efforts focused on the management, legal and compliance requirements of data storage.

**Web applications:** Infrastructure needed to host web apps is provided by IaaS. Therefore, if an organization is hosting a web application, IaaS can provide the necessary storage resources, servers and networking. Deployments can be made quickly, and the cloud infrastructure can be easily scaled up or down according to the application's demand.

**High-performance computing (HPC):** Certain workloads may demand HPC-level computing, such as scientific computations, financial modeling and product design work.

**Data warehousing and big data analytics:** IaaS can provide the necessary compute and processing power to comb through big data sets.


## **PaaS (Platform as a service)**
PAAS, an acronym for Platform As A Service, is a cloud delivery service model for various applications. SaaS provides its users with an elastic scaling of their apps. In this way, the developers can build various services and applications over the internet itself. These services can be private, public, or even hybrid.

Companies and developers can use the framework (that PaaS provides) to easily and quickly customize (and build) apps. Hence, the developers can instead focus on the application software while still not being bothered about managing various infrastructure matters (like software updates, operating systems, etc.). So, the IT managers only need to manage the software/application and remove the rest of the clutter. 
<br>
Examples of PaaS offered by different cloud providers include AWS Cloud9, AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeDeploy, Google App Engine, Cloud Dataflow, Azure CDN, App Services, Apple Developer Xcode etc.

## **USE CASES**
There is a multitude of use cases for PaaS, in a wide range of business contexts. Below are some of the most important ones, as listed by Gartner.

**API Development and Management**<br>
PaaS is useful for companies that develop, run, and manage app programming interfaces and microservices. This also goes for the development of new APIs and end-to-end API management.

**Business Intelligence and Analytics** <br>
PaaS tools allow for advanced analysis of business data, to identify patterns, make predictions, and ultimately make more qualified and data-driven decisions. PaaS tools can help companies predict behaviors and events so that they’re able to plan better.

**Databases and Data Management** <br>
PaaS is suitable for setting up and managing an organization’s database. PaaS provides a scalable, secure, and on-demand platform for creating, administering, and maintaining databases. As research firm Forrester puts it: “The shift to the cloud for big data is on.”

**Communication and Collaboration** <br>
One of the great things about PaaS is that it can be a delivery mechanism for communication and collaboration. This means that features like voice, chat, and videos can be added to applications built on the PaaS.

**Worker Systems** <br>
A worker system is an essential part of any production-scale cloud application. The ability to run tasks in the background, process tasks at scale, or schedule jobs to run on regular schedules is crucial for handling the types of workloads and processing demands typical in a distributed application. The Ironworker platform is an example of PaaS making life easier for users.

**Internet of Things** <br>
With the explosive growth in IoT (Internet of Things), PaaS will play an increasingly important role. PaaS supports various programming languages, application environments, and tools, allowing for the connectivity and integrations needed in IoT deployments.

# **Saas (Software as a Service)**
SAAS is an acronym for Service As A Software. It is the most prevalent of all the cloud services -allowing its users to run existing online apps.

All the services ranging from application, data, runtime, middleware, operating system, virtualisation, servers, storage and networking are managed and scaled by the service providers following the instructions of the client during provisioning.

SaaS provides various software like word processing, email, design software, analytics, collaboration software, and other application hosts. SaaS applications can be directly accessed through web browsers- eliminating the need to install any application on a user's workstation.

A SaaS vendor manages operating systems, servers, data, applications, storage, and many more. Thus, an enterprise or user only needs to worry about software usage and employee access to it. SaaS works as a model software- deployed in the form of hosting service that anyone can access (in the form of Output Re-written / Rephrased Text) via the internet or by using a software delivery model.

The SaaS hosts its clients’ software and the associated data centrally. So, the clients can access them using an online browser via the web. The SaaS services assist in the deployment and development of modern apps.

Examples of SaaS services include Google G-Suite, Microsoft Office 365, Shopify, Salesforce, Netflix, Dropbox, Cisco WebEx, Concur, GoToMeeting, github etc.

# **Microsft**
 Microsoft 365, a popular software suite is available in various subscription plans and aimed at serving different market needs and segments.

Microsoft 365 consists of apps for home, business, and enterprise that include Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Microsoft Teams, Outlook, OneDrive, and much more. Microsoft apps that we are using such as email, calendaring, and office tools are examples of a SaaS model. However, you can download and use these apps on your personal computers.

## **Google**
 Google’s G Suite, also known as Google Workspace is a popular example of a SaaS. Google Apps consists of Gmail, Contacts, Calendar, Meet, Chat for communication, Drive for storage, Currents for employee management, Google Docs Suits for content creation, and education edition.<br>

 We all have used these apps and it is one of the best and free SaaS offerings from Google. Unlike Microsoft Office 365, Google workspace is purely cloud-based and can’t be downloaded on a personal laptop or desktop. Google Apps are very useful and used by millions of users every day for their various day-to-day activities. 

## **Shopify**
Shopify is all about eCommerce. This one-liner introduction is adequate for this widely-used eCommerce platform.

It provides its users with end-to-end eCommerce services that include easy setup, marketing, analytics, and integration with various platforms and tools that make eCommerce development easier than ever before.
