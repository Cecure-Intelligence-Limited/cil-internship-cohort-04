# Story of My Life

## This is a short description of my journey as a Product Manager.

I'm John Eke, a product manager and user experience expert. I started my tech journey as a product designer working on user experience and interfaces for software products
but developed an interest in product management because I'm passionate about building the right products for the right people. I want to ensure the products we build are
valuable to our users and also drive business impact. My skills include:

* Requirements gathering
* Market research and competitive analysis
* Product vision and strategy
* User stories and acceptance criteria
* Task and user flows
* Wireframing and interactive prototyping
* UX/UI Psychology
* Project management

Working with amazing teams building great technology is what I live for.
