# What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud Computing is a model that offers convenient, on-demand network access to a pool of shared resources. This may include data
storage, databases, servers, networking, tools, or any other resources that can be accessed through the internet.
  
Cloud computing is offered in various service models, each of which satisfies unique business requirements. Cloud computing services come mainly in three types of service models: SaaS (Software as a Service), IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), and PaaS (Platform as a Service).
  
## 1. SaaS
SaaS or Software as a Service is a model that gives quick access to cloud-based web applications. The vendor controls the entire computing stack, which you can access using a web browser. These applications run on the cloud and you can use them by a paid licensed subscription or for free with limited access.

SaaS does not require any installations or downloads in your existing computing infrastructure. This eliminates the need for installing applications on each of your computers with the maintenance and support taken over by the vendor. 

### Benefits:

Affordable – SaaS is affordable as it eliminates the costs involved in the purchase, installation, maintenance, and upgrades of computing hardware.

Anywhere Accessibility – With SaaS, you can access the services from anywhere using any device such as smartphones, which eliminates the constraints set by on-premise software.

Ready to Use – You can quickly set up SaaS services so that they become functional in no time. All it takes is that you sign up for the service to get access to fast and powerful computing resources.

### Why Should One Opt SaaS?
With SaaS, communication, transferring of content, and scheduling meetings are made easy. SaaS is the ideal choice for small-scale businesses that do not have the necessary budget and resources to deploy on on-premise hardware. Besides, companies that require frequent collaboration on their projects will find SaaS platforms useful.

### Examples of SaaS include 

1. Google Workspace 
2. Microsoft Office 365
3. Dropbox
4. Slack
5. Cecure Cloud

## 2. PaaS
Platform as a Service or PaaS is essentially a cloud base where you can develop, test, and organize the different applications for your business. Implementing PaaS simplifies the process of enterprise software development. The virtual runtime environment provided by PaaS gives a favorable space for developing and testing applications.

The entire resources offered in the form of servers, storage, and networking are manageable either by the company or a platform provider.

### Benefits:
Minimal Development Time – PaaS reduces the development time since the vendor provides all computing resources like server-side components, which simplifies the process and improves the focus of the development team.

Multiple Programming Language Support – PaaS offers support for multiple programming languages, which a software development company can utilize to build applications for different projects.

Enhanced Collaboration – With PaaS, your business can benefit from having enhanced collaboration, which will help integrate your team dispersed across various locations.

### Why Should One Opt PaaS?
PaaS is the preferred option if your project involves multiple developers and vendors. With PaaS, it is easy to create customized applications as it leases all the essential computing and networking resources.  Being a different model, PaaS simplifies the app development process that minimizes your organizational costs.

Besides, it is flexible and delivers the necessary speed in the process, which will rapidly improve your development times. A typical disadvantage with PaaS is that since it is built on virtualized technology, you will have less control over the data processing. In addition, it is also less flexible compared to the IaaS cloud model.

### Examples of PaaS include 

1. Heroku
2. Windows Azure
3. Google App Engine
4. Amazon EBS
5. Force.com

## 3. IaaS
IaaS or Infrastructure as a Service is basically a virtual provision of computing resources over the cloud. An IaaS cloud provider can give you the entire range of computing infrastructures such as storage, servers, networking hardware alongside maintenance and support.

Businesses can opt for computing resources of their requirement without the need to install hardware on their premises.

### Benefits:

Minimize Costs – Deploying an IaaS cloud model eliminates the need to deploy on-premise hardware that reduces the costs.

Enhanced Scalability – As the most flexible cloud computing model, IaaS allows you to scale the computing resources up or down based on demand.

Simple Deployment – IaaS lets you easily deploy the servers, processing, storage, and networking to make it up and running in no time.

### Why Should One Opt IaaS?

IaaS being the most flexible of cloud models gives the best option when it comes to IT hardware infrastructure. IaaS is the right option if you need control over the hardware infrastructure such as managing and customizing according to your requirements.

Whether you are running a startup or a large enterprise, IaaS gives access to computing resources without the need to invest in them separately. 

### Examples of IaaS include

1. AWS EC2
2. AWS S3
3. Google Compute Engine
4. Digital Ocean
5. AWS Elastic Block Storage
