## What is a cloud service provider?

A cloud service provider, or CSP, is a company that offers components of cloud computing -- typically, infrastructure as a service (IaaS), software as a service (SaaS) or platform as a service (PaaS).

Cloud service providers use their own data centers and compute resources to host cloud computing-based infrastructure and platform services for customer organizations. Cloud services typically are priced using various pay-as-you-go subscription models.
