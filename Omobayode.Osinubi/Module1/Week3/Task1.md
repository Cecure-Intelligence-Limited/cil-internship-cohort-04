# Software Development Process
## Question1 
## Scrum  
Scrum is a software product development strategy that organizes software developers as a team to reach a common goal — creating a ready-for-market product. It is a widely used subset of agile software development.  

## Benefits of Scrum  
* Developers who want the freedom to make decisions thrive in scrum teams. Team morale tends to be high.
* Each sprint produces a product that is ready for market even though the project is ongoing. The highest priority requirements are addressed first so a high-quality, low-risk product can be on the market.
* The incremental process shortens the time to market by about 30 percent to 40 percent. Because the product owner is part of the scrum team, requirements can be delivered as they are needed.
* Scrum projects often realize a higher return on investment (ROI). This is attributed to:  
    i.  Decreased time to market.  
    ii. Early and regular feedback that prompts course corrections early when they are less costly.  
    iii. Defects that are fewer and less costly.  
    iv. Projects failing early and quickly when it’s less costly.
* Reviewing each sprint before the team moves on to the next sprint spreads testing throughout development.
* Project focus and goals can change with evolving business goals.
