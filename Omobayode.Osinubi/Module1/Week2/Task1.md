## Describe any layered process you are familiar with similar to the OSI model.

## TCP/IP 
TCP/IP is a communication standard that helps power the internet.  

## What are the layers of the TCP/IP model?  
There are four layers of the TCP/IP model: network access, internet, transport, and application. Used together, these layers are a suite of protocols. The TCP/IP model passes data through these layers in a particular order when a user sends information, and then again in reverse order when the data is received.  

## Layer 1: Network Access Layer  
The network access layer, also known as the data link layer, handles the physical infrastructure that lets computers communicate with one another over the internet. This covers ethernet cables, wireless networks, network interface cards, device drivers in your computer, and so on.  

The network access layer also includes the technical infrastructure — such as the code that converts digital data into transmittable signals — that makes network connection possible.  

## Layer 2: Internet Layer  
The internet layer, also known as the network layer, controls the flow and routing of traffic to ensure data is sent speedily and accurately. This layer is also responsible for reassembling the data packet at its destination. If there’s lots of internet traffic, the internet layer may take a little longer to send a file, but there will be a smaller chance of an error corrupting that file.

## Layer 3: Transport Layer  
The transport layer provides a reliable data connection between two communicating devices. It’s like sending an insured package: The transport layer divides the data in packets, acknowledges the packets it has received from the sender, and ensures that the recipient acknowledges the packets it receives.


## Layer 4: Application Layer  
The application layer is the group of applications that let the user access the network. For most of us that means email, messaging apps, and cloud storage programs. This is what the end-user sees and interacts with when sending and receiving data.
