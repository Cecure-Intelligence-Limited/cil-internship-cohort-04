Q1. Describe any layered process you are familiar with similar to the OSI model

Ans : TCP/IP model
1. Application layer
2. Transport layer
3. Network layer
4. Data Link Layer
5. Physical Layer



■ Physical Layer: Contains all the functions needed to carry the bit stream over a physical medium to another system.

■ Data Link Layer: Organizes the bit stream into a data unit called a “frame” and delivers the frame to an adjacent system.

■ Network Layer: Delivers data in the form of a packet from source to destination, across as many links as necessary, to non-adjacent systems.

■ Transport Layer: Concerned with process-to-process delivery of information.

■ Application Layer: Concerned with differences in internal representation, user interfaces, and anything else that the user requires.
