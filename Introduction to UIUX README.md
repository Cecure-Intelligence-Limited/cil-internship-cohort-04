# case study on YouTube

### **Good UX**

1. Usability: Learnability as soon as you enter YouTube's desktop or mobile app (if signed in), you are automatically greeted by recommended videos based on your video watching patterns or (if you are signed) on what's currently trending. its intelligent algorithm system makes sure that the user will have somehing interesting to watch even if you don't know where to begin.

2. Gradual updates: Updates are quite gradual as not to overwhelm the user with sudden changes. even a child could navigate their way through the app and wouldn't be severely impacted by YouTube frequent updates.

3. Memorability: If you write something incorrectly in the search bar, corrected texts will appear and try to match videos to what you're trying to search for as much as possible until you end up finding the right video.

### **Bad UX**

1. Dark Patterns: These are the tricks used in website and apps that makes you do things that you didn't mean to, YouTube recommender algorithm is so good it gets me everytime as i uselessly try to stop myself from watching another video after completing a 2-minute, 5-minute, 10-minute or even a 14-minute video! The endless list of recommended videos never seizes to capture m attention.

2. YouTube Ads: Ads are constantly annoying since they appear when i least expect them. The majority of the time, i cant wait to click the skip button.

### **Introduction**

UI and UX design and two of the often confused and conflicted terms in web and app design. They are usually placed together in a single term and viewed from the surface they seem to be describing the same thing. It's often hard to find solid descriptions of the two that don't descend too far into jargon. The truth is UX and UI are two sides of the same coin thinking of it this way: UX is all about how a product feels. UI is all about a product looks.UI design refers to User Interface design, while UX design stands for User Experience design. UI is how something looks and how you interact with it. UX is how something works.

## **What is User Interface (UI) design?**

UI design is the process of creating software or digital device interfaces with an emphasis on aesthetics or style. Designers strive to produce appealing, user-friendly designs making user interactions as essay and effective as feasible is the aim of user interface design. 

A well-designed user interface makes it easier to complete the task and hand without calling attention to itself. By affecting how the interacts with the interface anfd enhancing the design's visual appeal, graphic design and typography are used to promote usabiity. Design aesthetics may either improve or impair users' ability interface's features.

### **Why is the User Interface design important?**

User Interface design is crucial since it has the power to increase or decrease your clientele. It may mean the differenes between an app or website succeeding or failure. It may also deterine whether visitors to your website remain or leave. 

### **What is UX design?**

User Experience (UX) design is the process design teams use to create products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users. This involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the product including aspects of branding, design, usability and function. UX design is the process of enhancing user satisfaction with a product by improving the usability, accessibility and pleasure provided with the product. User Experience design encompasses traditional human-computer interaction (HCI) designed and extent it by addressing all aspect of a product of service as perceived by users.

### **Why is User Experience design important?**

In the case of a wbsite, UX includes everything from aesthetics to whether or not the site is usable, and it plays a vital role in your company's success. Customers who have positive experiences are likely to return, while those who don't can form negative opinions of your brand that they'll share with others. In the case of a product, UX designers are responsible for the user experience (UX) of a product. Their job is to ensure that the product logically flows from one step to the next. UX designers solve for usability first and aesthetics second.

### **UI vs UX Design**: **The difference between the two**.

UI design and UX design go hand-in-hand: You can have one without the other. User interface (UI) design is about making the product look good. It's about having colors, borders, icons, shadows and all sorts of other visual flairs. It's also about making sure that those elements fit into a larger hole that makes sense from both a visual and functional perspective. User Experience (UX) design is the process of systematically improving a product so that it is more intuitive, efficient and user-friendly. Doing so involves considering how different parts of the product interacts with each other and how they are perceived by users.

### **So what's the difference?**

Both elements are crucial to a product and work closely together but despite their professional relationship, the roles themselves are quite different, referring to very different parts of the process and the design discipline. Where UX design is a more analytical and technical field, UI is closer to what we refer to as graphic design, though the responsibility as somewhat more complex.

### **Conclusion**

UI and UX work together but are different. UI is more analytical. It's rooted in cognitive behaviour and human psychology. UI design software is focused more on the visuals then--or whether a product is aesthetically pleasing. The UX design process is the framework or strategy that guides how a designer or team of designers tackles a project. It's the series of steps or actions a designer takes to best solve a problem for their user.
