# Case studies review

Going through the first case study on “for the love of food and ux”showed me the impact and process of improving a feature in an existing application, from the research approach to deciphering the problem and the process of solving the problem using UX tools peculiar to the issue. It opened my eyes to storytelling in the UX Process and how approaching UX problems are not always the generic approach.

Moving to the second case study on Jumia food was very insightful in terms of the details in analyzing customer experience and also the approach to ensuring  both the business and customer efficiently achieve their goals by applying different UX laws as well as tools. 

It was very interesting to understand the design process in both scenarios.
