Cloud Computing

In recent years, the Internet revolution and technological evolution lead to new market opportunities in the outsourcing field. Now, Internet has a lot more capacity to let its users and companies interact with one another. The term “Cloud” refers metaphorically to the entire invisible infrastructure or network that the end-user cannot see because it is located in an external location, (i.e., Internet servers and network infrastructure). 
Cloud Computing appeared in the late 2000s. Eric Schmidt, Google’s CEO, was the first to use the term in a business context. But this is not an innovation coming from nowhere, but rather an evolutionary development of many different technologies like, for instance, the already presented application service providers or distributed information systems. Cloud computing is yet a growing industry and evolving technology. Many new services and possibilities arise in the market continuously. That is why many definitions can be found in the literature. One of the most accepted was written by the United States Institute of Standards and Technology: 
“Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storages, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.”
Cloud computing’s key characteristics like user-friendliness, standardization, scalability, location independence, or ubiquitous access can be found in many articles. Also, the NIST defined the five essential characteristics that define Cloud Computing:
On-Demand Self-Service. Computing capabilities can be acquired on-demand basis, without human interaction with providers.
Broad Network Access. Capabilities can be accessed through standard mechanisms or platforms, as they are available over the network.
Resource Pooling. A multi-tenant model is used by providers to pool capabilities to serve multiple customers at the same time. This aspect is also known as virtualization: multiple applications may be hosted on a common set of servers, and providers offer virtual machines (virtual dedicated servers) as the resources for applications.
Rapid elasticity. Capabilities can be rapidly provisioned and released.
Measured service. The usage of capabilities can be transparently monitored, controlled, and reported.
Cloud computing services can be implemented following four deployment models:

1.	Public cloud: When services offered by vendors can be accessed across the internet using systems shared among multiple customers.

2.	A private cloud: This is built, managed, and used internally by an enterprise and uses a shared services model with variable usage of the 
system’s resources.

3.	A hybrid cloud: is a combination of multiple internal computing resources and external cloud providers bound together.

4.	Community cloud: in which cloud infrastructure is shared by a limited group of organizations.
Cloud computing is represented as a stack system that is divided into three major service layers. These three service layers lean one on another and they are all borne on physical assets that are virtualized to make them accessible via the internet. Currently is accepted to categorize cloud computing services using the software, platform, and infrastructure (SPI) model, which refers to Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a service (IaaS).

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

The first of the three cloud service models focus on the infrastructure. The aim of infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is simple: to attract companies by lowering their total cost of ownership of the information system’s assets. Contracting this service model, companies acquire processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where they can deploy and run arbitrary software (e.g., operating systems or applications). The consumer cannot manage or control the cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications; and possibly limited control of some networking components (e.g., host firewalls). The main advantages for enterprises contracting this type of service are considered to be instant deployment, the ability to rapidly scale, the lower total cost of ownership, and predictable uptime. However, a key factor has been a determinant for the expansion of the model: Cloud Bursting, which has been the greatest value for customers. Cloud bursting is the process of offloading tasks to the cloud during times when most computing resources are needed. In other words, companies do not have to acquire assets to cover the most demanding runtimes but transfer some of the running processes to cloud infrastructures when needed. In this way, businesses would not need to invest in additional servers that only run at high or full-capacity two or three times a year, which allows them to invest in more economical solutions. In addition, IT departments must be able to build and implement the software that handles the ability to reallocate processes to the cloud. Companies like IBM offer specialized cloud-bursting software for their cloud computing services.

Mainly, the cloud-infrastructure services are based on three principal resources: computing power (equivalent to a CPU), computing memory (equivalent to RAM), and storage (equivalent to a Hard Disk Drive). All providers in the market offer these three characteristics. Many other attributes like software licensing, bandwidth, inbound or outbound transfer of files to the cloud, or accessible IP addresses also have to be included in the service. Offering more specific characteristics or adding them at attractive prices let infrastructure-as-a-service providers differentiate from their rivals in the market. The economic benefits consumers can expect from infrastructure as a service are:

1.	Lower purchasing costs, because providers often have greater purchasing power than single companies and the pooled resources are redistributed in the bandwidth,

2.	Avoiding technology obsolescence, as providers are very likely to acquire the latest technologies, and

3.	Unparalleled expertise is because providers recruit top talents, which may be unavailable economically to some companies. 
At the moment, some of the most important infrastructure-as-a-service providers are Terremark, IBM cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Alibaba Cloud, Rackspace, Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Google Compute Engine (GCE).

Best Use Cases for IaaS

A successful IaaS strategy can help companies focus on business growth and on meeting business-critical objectives instead of focusing on the infrastructure. Some of the best use cases for adopting IaaS:

1.	Enabling add-on services: in addition to providing day-to-day computing resources, IaaS allows users to layer a wide range of services on top of the infrastructure. That might include computing-as-a-service, disaster recovery-as-a-service, analytics or BI-as-a-service, and more.

2.	Big Data Analysis: Managing, storing and analyzing big data like structured data (i.e., databases) and unstructured data (i.e., social media, images, web, emails, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors) require a significant amount of processing power. IaaS is a perfect environment to manage big data because it can handle large workloads and can integrate with business intelligence tools. This delivers business insights that can help users predict trends, improve relationships with customers, and create new products and services.

3.	Disaster recovery: With a robust and scalable infrastructure layer, organizations can consolidate their disparate disaster recovery systems into one virtualized environment for disaster recovery. This diversification of the backup systems gives businesses peace of mind knowing that their data is secure.

4.	Testing and development: The computing and networking power behind IaaS makes it a perfect place to run and manage testing and development cycles. With SLAs in place from providers and a high level of security, enterprises can trust IaaS to run business-critical projects and get to market faster with higher scalability of computing resources.

5.	Networking services: Because the network continues to grow in complexity, many are turning to IaaS service providers to deliver networking-as-a-service support. This may be for a short-term big data project, or to support ongoing initiatives, freeing up internal IT staff for other priorities.

6.	Hosting Complex Websites
While IaaS is not always appropriate for simple websites, it can be the optimal basis for more complex web projects. Particularly for sites with profoundly fluctuating traffic. A website hosted in the cloud, for instance, can profit from the verbosity rendered by a massive network of physical servers and demand scalability to manage unanticipated demands
When deciding to move infrastructure to the cloud and evaluating service providers, look for those that match business requirements such as expertise, availability guarantees, price, and security certifications, for example. Those vendors that deliver 24/7 support and make it easy to move workloads to and from the cloud environment can help businesses improve efficiencies and differentiate themselves from the competition.
 
Platform as a Service (PaaS)

Platform as a service (PaaS) refers to a cloud-computing model in which the vendor provides the infrastructure to the customer, who acquires the capability to deploy its own-made web applications or acquired ones, using programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider. The user can configure settings for the application-hosting environment but has no control over the underlying cloud infrastructure. In other words, offers developers the possibility to build and deploy web applications on a hosted infrastructure. Furthermore, it can also be used to test, host and maintain applications, covering the complete life cycle of building and delivering web applications and services. Platform as a service consists of two basic elements. The first one is the computing platform, a place where software can be launched consistently as long as the code meets the standards of that platform so that the applications deployed in the cloud fit the current computing platform of the provider. The second is the set of applications that will assist in the development process as well as the deployment of the application. In comparison to software as a service, this model allows customers to develop their applications rather than acquire them, achieving a higher level of customization.
The adoption of platform as a service has been slower compared to software as a service, because of the programming languages, that have different options among the main providers, but not a standardized solution. These phenomena can create a lock-in problem, typically seen in outsourcing, due to the difficult or even impossible transmission from one provider to another (each one uses its developed programming language). Also, the transition from a traditional on-premise applications development platform can be a tough issue, as the new programming models have to be learned.
The actual most important providers in the platform as a service market are Force, Caspio, Google app engine, and Microsoft Azure. Gartner group argued that in 2008 the platform as a service market represents approximately 1.5% of the total application development market, and expected this value to grow up to 10% by 2013.
According to Forrester’s research, Platform-as-a-service will become a middleware platform alternative. Pre-integrated and, in many cases, simplified platforms for the development of general-purpose business applications will become a serious alternative shortly for developing custom applications. Also, independent software vendors will find them a highly attractive option for delivering software-a-service applications.

Use Cases for PaaS

There are multiple use cases for PaaS, in a wide range of business contexts. Below are some of the most important ones use cases.

1.	API Development and Management
PaaS is useful for companies that develop, run and manage Application Programming Interfaces and microservices. This also goes for the development of new APIs and end-to-end API management.

2.	Business Intelligence and Analytics
PaaS tools allow for advanced analysis of business data, to identify patterns, make predictions, and ultimately make more qualified and data-driven decisions. PaaS tools can help companies predict behaviors and events so that they arere able to plan and predict better.

3.	Databases and Data Management
PaaS is suitable for setting up and managing an organization’s database. PaaS provides a scalable, secure, and on-demand platform for creating, administering, and maintaining databases. As research firm Forrester puts it: “The shift to the cloud for big data is on.” For instance, Azure SQL Database is a fully managed platform as a service (PaaS) database engine that handles most of the database management functions such as upgrading, patching, backups, and monitoring without user involvement.

4.	Communication And Collaboration
One of the great things about PaaS is that it can be a delivery mechanism for communication and collaboration. This means that features like voice, chat, and videos can be added to applications built on the PaaS.

5.	Worker Systems
A worker system is an essential part of any production-scale cloud application. The ability to run tasks in the background, process tasks at scale, or schedule jobs to run on regular schedules is crucial for handling the types of workloads and processing demands typical in a distributed application. For example, the Ironworker platform is an example of PaaS making life easier for users. An ironworker platform is a container-based background job processing solution, which comes with detailed analytics for developers to run front-end tasks, assigned/schedule jobs, and offload tasks on a serverless platform. The app enables businesses to create custom worker code, as well as package and upload it on the system and queue up tasks against it. IronWorker enables users to operate Docker-based workflows to sync local environments with the production environment.

6.	Internet of Things (IoT)
With the explosive growth in IoT (Internet of Things), PaaS play an increasingly important role. PaaS supports various programming languages, application environments, and tools, allowing for the connectivity and integrations needed in IoT deployments. The key driver behind smart and secure homes is IoT. A variety of sensors, lights, alarms, and cameras (all of which can be controlled from an app) are connected via IoT to provide 24x7 security.

Software as a Service (SaaS)

Software as a service is a software delivery model, developed since the SaaS conference offered by SDForum took place in 2005 and was for the first time accepted as a business model. It is defined as the provision of capabilities for the customers to use the provider’s applications running on the cloud infrastructure possessed also by the provider. Users can access the applications from either a thin client interface (e.g., a web browser) or a dedicated program interface. The user of SaaS does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure, which is mainly the information system infrastructure. The only possible need for the company to acquire the services is a limited user-specific application configuration setting. The result is a cost-effective Internet-based service offered with a low entry, zero infrastructure, and low customization cost by providers. Most of the websites we visit daily are based on this model, for example, Google docs, Zoho, or any online mail website.
According to the definition, Software as a Service has many similarities to the application service provider’s model. But also, many differences. The first, and more important, is that software is developed by the service providers, instead of contracting or licensing it to a software vendor as seen in application service providing. 
Implementation time and usability are widely improved in software as a service. Also, the Internet speed allows new data transfer levels unreachable at the time when the application service providing was developed. The main advantages companies can benefit from are:

1.	Cost saving, because users can save information technology costs by renting just needed applications for their business, and purchasing and maintaining costs could be minimized,

2.	Better resources utilization, referring to the use of the cost savings for more strategic processes,

3.	Application access scalability, thanks to the multi-tenant structure that allows to scale up or down client’s application access, and

4.	The possibility of outsourcing more globally, allowing vendors to be located overseas.
According to Deloitte, the Software as a service market accounted 2008 for 8.1 billion USD worldwide, which represents 7.7% of total enterprise application revenues and was the largest component of the Cloud computing market (89%). Last studies predict that by 2015 Software as a Service will represent about 13.1% of worldwide software spending and that 14.4% of applications spending will be SaaS-based in the same time period. There are nowadays lots of services provided through this delivery model. Some of the most successful ones and with higher growing perspectives are customer relationship management, supply chain management, integration as a service (i.e., data transportation between enterprise-wide systems and third parties), enterprise resource planning, and content, communication and collaboration software (e.g., web conferencing, e-learning, e-mail or team collaboration).
