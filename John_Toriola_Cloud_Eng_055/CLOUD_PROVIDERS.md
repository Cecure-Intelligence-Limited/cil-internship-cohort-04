# Cloud Service Providers
What is a cloud service provider? A cloud service provider is a third-party company offering a cloud-based platform, infrastructure, application, or storage services.  
The biggest service providers in order of their market share are:
## Amazon Web Service
Widely considered the top cloud company. Truly the company that pulled the world into the cloud – AWS continues to grow and innovate at a pace that shows no sign of complacency.
Some of AWS most popular services are:

#### Amazon EC2
EC2 is an compute service and it's the most popular service on the platform.  
As an example of IaaS, EC2 instances are a reliable and comparatively cheap alternative to physical hardware. EC2 users have the option of creating instances of seven different types, with each type having various subtypes (e.g. Mac for developers looking to develop on macOS, P4 for high performance workloads, and High Memory for large in-memory databases) to cater to distinct usage requirements.
#### Amazon Lambda
Lambda is another compute service that aims to save time and resources over EC2 instances by reducing management and setup requirements at the cost of flexibility. Where EC2 instances fall under IaaS, Lamda is an example of serverless computing and thus does not require virtual servers to run. 
#### Amazon ECS
This is the simplest and most widely used AWS solution for operating a large scale of containers. ECS supports Docker containers and allows users to run containerized applications through the AWS interface. As a managed service, ECS allows its users to deploy and build containers without worrying about security and scalability.
#### Amazon DynamoDB
DynamoDB is a database that allows users to map keys to attributes and values to allow easy access to records. It’s a document database that is available across multiple regions, and the service is managed fully with included security and backup options.

## Microsoft Azure
Azure is a cloud computing service provided by Microsoft. It offers a wide range of services, including compute, storage, networking, and databases. Also, Azure provides a variety of tools that are used to develop and deploy applications.
#### Azure Active Directory
Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a cloud-based identity and access management service. It helps businesses manage employee accounts and control access to company data.

It is optimised for low latency, large numbers of reads and writes, and for maintaining performance at scale.
