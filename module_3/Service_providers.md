DIFFERENT CLOUD SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THEIR OFFERINGS


1. Amazon Web Services (AWS): Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud computing service of Amazon.com, is the largest cloud service provider globally. From its data centers, the business provides over 200 fully featured services including compute, storage, and database.
AWS offers public, private and hybrid cloud services. AWS private cloud offering is called Amazon Virtual Private Cloud or Amazon VPC. VPC lets you create a private instance of public AWS resources, complete with its core capabilities.
The AWS Outposts is an on-premises device owned and operated by AWS. IT teams use it to host and provision AWS resources, such as EBS volumes and EC2 instances, on-premises as they did in the cloud. So it is possible if a company wants to move workloads in-house or sync cloud and on-premises infrastructure. Outpost supports AWS services, such as EC2, EBS, and other container-based solutions but doesn’t support Lambda, S3, or SageMaker.
AWS Direct Connect gives you direct access to Amazon Web Services through a private, direct connection—reducing costs, increasing security and ensuring more consistent network performance.
Key features: The key features of AWS private cloud solution include:

- Access to the scalable infrastructure of AWS
- Easy setup using AWS Management Console or Command Line Interface (CLI)
- Customizable virtual networking environment with the option to choose an IP address, subnets, and root tables
- Partnerships with Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, Sophos, Check Point Software, and others for private cloud security
- A Reachability Analyzer tool to debug network connectivity between two resources


Pricing depends on the resources and services you use and the number of hours for which you use them.


2. Cisco: Cisco has an impressive portfolio of private cloud solutions and enablers, including data center offerings, infrastructure management packages, business applications, and cloud management tools. It is built on a modular architecture so you can migrate, retrofit, and implement the components you want. Cisco also assists in the implementation stage of the journey through its assessment optimization and extension services.
The key features for Cisco are;

Pricing depends on the solution modules you choose and the specific infrastructure mix.


3. Microsoft Azure: Microsoft Azure is right behind AWS. Though they started late, they rose through the competition by migrating their on-premises software to the cloud. As software like Microsoft Office and Sharepoint already had a market, it was a no-brainer for several companies to follow it to the cloud. While it is relatively simple to manage once things have been set up, you may still need help at some point. But there is an expert support team and documentation available to offer support.

Microsoft also has a powerful private cloud offering through Azure Stack. Using Azure Stack, you can build and run applications across a wide range of environments, from data centers and edge locations to remote offices or even the public cloud. Microsoft’s private cloud capabilities cover IoT implementations, hyperconverged infrastructure, and the Azure Stack hub for running autonomous cloud instances on-premise.
The key features of Microsoft’s private cloud solution include:
- Industry-specific private cloud solutions for financial services, governments, manufacturing, retail, and healthcare
- Azure Stack Edge to enable ML-based data processing for edge devices
- Scalable virtualization and storage through Azure HCI
- Azure ExpressRoute to enable high-speed private connections from on-premise infrastructure to Azure networks
- Robust resource library and documentation, including an active Azure Stack community


The pricing for Azure Stack follows a pay-per-use pricing model, depending on the solutions you choose.

The Azure services are designed on Windows Server, .Net framework, and Visual Studio, allowing migration of on-premises apps to services completely hassle-free. As Microsoft embraces Kubernetes, containers, and Linux with open arms, it offers good support for open-source products.

Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute provides a secure, private connection between your IT deployment and Microsoft Azure and Office 365.



4. Google Cloud : Like Amazon, public cloud giant Google also offers a virtual private cloud (VPC) product built on its cloud resources. It enables a highly customizable network environment for hosting your public or private assets. You can control how different workloads connect regionally and globally while also gaining from packet mirroring partners like Cisco, Check Point Software, and Palo Alto Networks, among others.
Google Cloud Platform is an ideal suggestion for companies that use containers, as they have the Kubernetes standard that other cloud providers have now started using. It stands at the third position after AWS and Microsoft regarding market share. The company is striving hard to enhance its offerings and number of data centers globally to narrow down the gap. It offers better customer support and documentation for the platform and APIs.
GCP achieve low latency network compute performance and easily manage the network availability and flexibility that comes with dedicated connectivity via Google Cloud Interconnect.
Some of the Key features of GCP are;
- Automatic setup of virtual topology, subnets, and network policies with the option for manual configurations.
- Packet mirroring and network traffic monitoring at scale to detect intrusion and ensure performance.
- Network segmentation through a globally distributed firewall
- Shared VPC, where multiple projects can leverage the VPC network with individualized management and billing for each project.
- Access to Google services (storage, analytics, machine learning, etc.) without using a public IP address

Google VPC is priced depending on the nature and volume of services used. Traffic movements within the same region or between regions in the U.S. are the least expensive at $0.01 per GB. In other regions, this ranges from $0.08 to $0.23 per GB.



5. IBM Cloud : IBM is among the world’s leading private cloud providers, and it is among the few companies with no public cloud offerings. The company acquired Red Hat to further advance its cloud-based business strategy.

IBM’s private cloud solution is priced based on your product and volume usage.

6. OpenStack : OpenStack is a unique cloud provider, with its open-source focus acting as a key differentiator. The OpenStack platform was envisioned as an open-source private cloud that would help anyone manage computing, network, and storage resources without heavy capital expenses. OpenStack works with managed service providers and system integrators around the world to provide enterprise private cloud solutions.
