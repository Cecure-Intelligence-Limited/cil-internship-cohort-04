              SERVICE MODELS

Service Models are usually divided into three categories names: Software as a service (SaaS), Platform as a service (PaaS, and Infrastructure as a service (IaaS).



1. SaaS: Software as a Service offers applications that are accessed over the web and are not managed by your company, but by the software provider. This relieves your organization from the constant pressure of software maintenance, infrastructure management, network security, data availability, and all the other operational issues involved with keeping applications up and running. SaaS billing is typically based on factors such as number of users, usage time, amount of data stored, and number of transactions processed. This service model has the largest market share in cloud computing, as well as the largest revenue. Current applications for SaaS include Field Service solutions, system monitoring solutions, schedulers and more.


2. PaaS: Platform as a Service is halfway between Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). It offers access to a cloud-based environment in which users can build and deliver applications without the need of installing and working with IDEs (Integrated Development Environments, which are often very expensive. Additionally, users can often customize the features they want included with their subscription. According to Gartner, PaaS has the smallest market share of the three service models. PaaS providers offer applications such as Microsoft Azure (also IaaS), Google App Engine, and Apache Stratos.


3. IaaS: Infrastructure as a service offers a standardized way of acquiring computing capabilities on demand and over the web. Such resources include storage facilities, networks, processing power, and virtual private servers. These are charged under a “pay as you go” model where you are billed by factors such as how much storage you use or the amount of processing power you consume over a certain timespan. In this service model, customers do not need to manage infrastructure, it is up to the provider to guarantee the contracted amount of resources and availability. IaaS services offered today, include Google Cloud Platform and Amazon EC2.



Cloud computing has been around for quite some time now; however, it will continue to evolve as faster and more reliable networks offer increased benefits to service providers and consumers alike. With these advancements, there are growing opportunities to develop business models in an increasingly-connected economy.



           CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICE MODEL USE CASES
Some of the most common use cases of cloud computing service models are illustrated below;

1. Production Migration: Migrating production services from an on-premise solution into the cloud is one of the most common cloud computing use cases. This allows companies to take advantage of all of the benefits of the cloud. Some companies have even chosen to host all of their infrastructure in the cloud.

2. Traffic Bursting: If you’re in the retail business, for example, demand on your e-commerce infrastructure will spike over certain periods of the year (Christmas, for example). In a classic data center environment, you’d need to provision your compute, storage, and network capacity to reflect this. This is not an effective method of scaling. You will be paying for extra infrastructure that you may only use for a couple of months of the year. Cloud computing offers a far better method for handling peak traffic loads. The public cloud can be used to scale your network and resources to manage and handle this additional traffic over your peak season. When traffic has reduced, you can terminate your infrastructure within the cloud. Remember, you only pay for what you use, when you use it.

3. Backup and Disaster Recovery: The public cloud’s built-in resiliency and durability offers a great backup solution. To a degree, you have access to unlimited storage space with built-in data lifecycle management policies, which allows you to make use of even cheaper storage. For example, using Amazon Web Services, you could implement a policy to archive any data that is over 30 days old to AWS Glacier, a cold storage service with an even lower storage cost. The data is then available as long as you have access to the internet. These storage services are often replicated by the vendor to ensure durability.

4. Web Hosting: Many organizations choose to host their web services in the cloud because it can balance the load across multiple servers and scale up and down quickly and automatically with traffic. The ability to provision and implement automatic scaling simplifies the whole process and takes out much of the administrative input and maintenance required. Businesses can also make use of services such as Content Delivery Networks (CDN) and Domain Name Services (DNS).

5. Testing and Development: As with traffic bursting, you may not have the capacity to host lots of servers and storage in your data center for testing and development purposes. This would also be a huge expense. Using the public cloud allows you to spin up servers as you need them, and then shut them down when you’re finished. This also allows you to provision the size and capacity of your compute resources. For example, If you just need a high and powerful server for an hour’s worth of testing, then you can have it. Having this wide range of compute resources within your own data center would be costly.

6. Proof of Concept: The cloud allows you to implement a proof of concept design and helps you bring ideas to life at a fraction of the cost. The results of your proof of concept can help you build a successful business case when presenting to senior management.

7. Big Data and Data Manipulation: The cloud also makes it easier and cheaper to manage Big Data. Maintaining and implementing compute resources to handle huge datasets can be expensive and complicated. Using cloud computing resources, you can use only the resources you need to analyze data when you need them. Some public cloud vendors offer specialized managed Big Data services that gives you managed resource infrastructure and a framework on which to run your workloads. With a vendor managing some of these elements, you can focus on data processing and not worry about the underlying architecture.


FIVE SAMPLES OF EACH OF THE MODEL

1. SaaS: Examples of SaaS include Salesforce, Shopify, Dropbox, Google Applications, MailChimp.


2. PaaS: Examples of PaaS includes AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku, Google App Engine, Force.com, OpenShift.


3. IaaS: Examples of IaaS include Rackspace, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine (GCE).
