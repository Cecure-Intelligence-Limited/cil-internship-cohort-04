## Service Models
Cloud computing is a general term used to identify online delivery of data storage, processing, analytics, and other services, online without being dependent on local hardware. The businesses connect to the provider and use third-party services to enable their computing operations.

Further, cloud services can be distinguished based on their business model, functionality, and billing systems. Letâ€™s take a look at the main types of cloud-based services and examine their features and differences.
We can define service models as the ways a company offers tangable value to its users. Service Models provide the predefined analysis and design-level structures to enable more consistency and reuse in the creation of services.
Cloud services covers a wide range of resources that a service providers delivers to a customers via the internet, and these services can be divided into three based on the customers requirement and usage. They are:  

## Software As A Service (SaaS)
SaaS is also known as "on-demand software". It is a software in which the applications are hosted by a cloud service provider. Users can access these applications with the help of internet connection and web browser.
SAAS is a cloud-based software delivery model in which the cloud provider develops and maintains cloud application software, provides automatic software updates, and makes software available to its customers via the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis. The public cloud provider manages all the hardware and traditional software, including middleware, application software, and security.

# Characteristics of SaaS
* Managed from a central location
* Hosted on a remote server
* Accessible over the internet
* Users are not responsible for hardware and software updates. Updates are applied automatically.
* The services are purchased on the pay-as-per-use basis

**Example:** BigCommerce, Google Apps, Salesforce, Dropbox, ZenDesk, Cisco WebEx, ZenDesk, Slack, and GoToMeeting.


## Platform As A Service (PaaS)
PaaS cloud computing platform is created for the programmer to develop, test, run, and manage the applications.
(PaaS) provides a managed hosting environment, where you can deploy your application without needing to manage VMs or networking resources.
PaaS providers takes care of the underlying infrastructure like server, storage, networking etc, PaaS applications are normally easy to configure and Major programing languages are pre-configured for developers application development i.e the Developers are only responsible for their data and application.

# Characteristics of PaaS
* Accessible to various users via the same development application.
* Integrates with web services and databases.
* Builds on virtualization technology, so resources can easily be scaled up or down as per the organization's need.
* Support multiple languages and frameworks.
* Provides an ability to "Auto-scale".

**Example:** AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Windows Azure, Heroku, Force.com, Google App Engine, Apache Stratos, Magento Commerce Cloud, and OpenShift.

## Infrastructure As A Service (IaaS)
It is a computing infrastructure managed over the internet. The main advantage of using IaaS is that it helps users to avoid the cost and complexity of purchasing and managing the physical servers.
Services such as pay-as-you-go storage, networking, and virtualization are included in IaaS. IaaS Providers gives users cloud-based alternatives to on-premise infrastructure, so businesses can avoid investing in expensive on-site resources. they are mostly used by System Administrators.

# Characteristics of IaaS
* Resources are available as a service
* Services are highly scalable
* Dynamic and flexible
* GUI and API-based access
* Automated administrative tasks

**Example:** DigitalOcean, Linode, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine (GCE), Rackspace, and Cisco Metacloud.


## Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)
FAAS is a kind of cloud computing service that allows developers to build, compute, run, and manage application packages as functions without having to maintain their own infrastructure.
FaaS is an event-driven execution model that runs in stateless containers and those functions manage server-side logic and state through the use of services from a FaaS provider.
FaaS solutions are available on major public clouds and can be provisioned on-premise, adding significant new capabilities to enterprise IT for app development. Get the cloud-native strategy guide to prepare to implement a serverless approach with FaaS.

**Examples**: IBM Cloud Functions, Amazon's AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Microsoft Azure Functions (open source), OpenFaaS (open source)
