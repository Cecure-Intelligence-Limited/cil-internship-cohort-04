# What digital product do you use everyday?

A digital product that I use is WhatsApp. As we all know WhatsApp is a free messaging and video calling platform which provides encrypted messaging between people. It lays emphasis on the security and privacy of communication between people.

# Why I would want to improve the features?

I would want to improve it's features to create a business model which has been missing from the product. Creating a business model from which Meta can earn from. Some features existing and new features can switched to being used on a subscription basis. Features where users have to subscribe either weekly, monthly or yearly. An edit feature can also be introduced to make the correction of typographical errors to be easy and faster without anyone noticing. This enables messaging without noticing or being embarrassed about any obvious errors. Then a voice recording feature on the status and increasing the number of pinned chat can also be introduced. These features can also be made to be a paid feature which some users will want to have and use.

# How would I go about improving it's features? 

I would go about it by using the Lean Product development and management methodology.
I would start by knowing what phase of it's lifecycle the product is, which is the maturity phase as it is currently. Then I would conduct a customer and market research to see if there are similar features used by competitors and how consumers respond to using such features. After analysing the data gotten, I would then go on to test it on our product with few of our users and observe how the users respond to the paid features. Calculate how many users are paying for the features, how frequently and how long they're paying for. Analysing all these data will show us how to move forward with the planned feature improvement and development. If the data shows a favourable response from our users I'll have to sit down a develop a solid business strategy for the product and excellent feature strategy for the long term. Having a sales strategy and collaborating with the sales team to settle on pricing so as to monetize the new and some existing features. Something different and innovative to make our product and feature stand out from the competition.

# What is the Strategic Vision? 

My strategic vision is to build and develop features which facilitate and promote easy, error-free and secure messaging and features that will bring about good ROI to the organization.
