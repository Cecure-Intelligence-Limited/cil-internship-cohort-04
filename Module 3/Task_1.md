##  Task 1

#### Describe the Service models and talk about about cases where they are used 
#### Give 5 Samples for each of the models

### **SaaS**
Software as a Service (SaaS) is a software distribution method that let the customers and client interact and use software through internet enabled devices, making it convenient to carryout personal task and business objective. They are typically ready-to-use and run from a web browser, which allows skipping any additional downloads or application installations. 

### SaaS Characteristics
There are a few ways to help determine when SaaS is being utilized:
- Managed from a central location
- Hosted on a remote server
- Accessible over the internet
- Users not responsible for hardware or software updates

### Use Case 
- Startups or small companies that need to launch ecommerce quickly and don’t have time for server issues or software
- Short-term projects that require quick, easy, and affordable collaboration
- Applications that aren’t needed too often, such as tax software
- Applications that need both web and mobile access
- SaaS platforms are ideal for when you want an application to run smoothly and reliably with minimal input from you.

### Examples of SaaS
1. Google Workspace eg.  Gmail, Google Drive, GoogleTask, Colab
2. Slack, 
3. Microsoft 365, Microsoft outlook, 
4. Figma
5. Github



### **PaaS**
PaaS, or Platform-as-a-Service, is a cloud computing model that provides customers a complete cloud platform—hardware, software, and infrastructure—for developing, running, and managing applications without the cost, complexity, and inflexibility that often comes with building and maintaining that platform on-premises.

### PaaS Characteristics
PaaS has many characteristics that define it as a cloud service, including:
- Builds on virtualization technology, so resources can easily be scaled up or down as your business changes
- Provides a variety of services to assist with the development, testing, and deployment of apps
- Accessible to numerous users via the same development application
- Integrates web services and databases

### Uses Case
1. __Software and API Development and Management__:
PaaS is useful for companies that develop, run, and manage app programming interfaces and microservices (APIs and SaaS). This also goes for the development of new APIs and end-to-end API management. Because of its built-in frameworks, PaaS makes it much simpler for teams to develop, run, manage and secure APIs (application programming interfaces) for sharing data and functionality between applications.
2. __Business Intelligence, Analytics, IoT__:
PaaS tools allow for advanced analysis of business data, to identify patterns, make predictions, and ultimately make more qualified and data-driven decisions. PaaS tools can help companies predict behaviors and events so that they’re able to plan better. Out of the box, PaaS can support a range of programming languages (Java, Python, Swift, etc.), tools and application environments used for IoT application development and real-time processing of data generated by IoT devices.
3. __Communication and Collaboration__
One of the great things about PaaS is that it can be a delivery mechanism for communication and collaboration. This means that features like voice, chat, and videos can be added to applications built on the PaaS.
4. __Worker Systems, Deployment Automation, Agile development and DevOps__
A worker system is an essential part of any production-scale cloud application. The ability to run tasks in the background, process tasks at scale, or schedule jobs to run on regular schedules is crucial for handling the types of workloads and processing demands typical in a distributed application. PaaS can provide fully-configured environments for automating the software application lifecycle including integration, delivery, security, testing and deployment.
5. __Container Orchestration__
Container management platforms offering functionality to solve challenges of containerization process and implementation of cloud-native approach for existing or new applications. Many PaaS vendors now offer CaaS as an integral component of their products, further reinforcing the view of PaaS as a collection of different DevOps tools.

### Examples of PaaS
1. AWS Elastic Beanstalk, 
2. Heroku,  
3. OpenShift, 
4. Apache Stratos, 
5. Google App Engine


### **IaaS**
IaaS is internet access to 'raw' IT infrastructure—physical servers, virtual machines, storage, networking, firewalls—hosted by a cloud provider. IaaS eliminates cost and work of owning, managing and maintaining on-premises infrastructure. With IaaS the organization provides its own application platform and applications. 

### IaaS Characteristics
Characteristics that define IaaS include:
- Resources are available as a service
- Cost varies depending on consumption
- Services are highly scalable
- Multiple users on a single piece of hardware
- Organization retain complete control of the infrastructure
- Dynamic and flexible

# Use Case for IaaS
1. __Enabling add-on services__: in addition to providing day-to-day computing resources, IaaS allows users to layer a wide-range of services on top of the infrastructure. That might include computing-as-a-service, disaster recovery-as-a-service, analytics or BI-as-a-service, and more.
2. __Big data__: Managing, storing, and analyzing big data like structured data (i.e., databases) and unstructured data (i.e., social media, images, web, emails, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors) requires a significant amount of processing power. IaaS is a perfect environment to manage big data because it can handle large workloads and can integrate with business intelligence tools. This delivers business insights that can help users predict trends, improve relationships with customers, and create new products and services.
3. __Disaster recovery__: With a robust and scalable infrastructure layer, organizations can consolidate their disparate disaster recovery systems into one virtualized environment for disaster recovery. This diversification of the backup systems gives businesses peace of mind knowing that their data is secure.
4. __Testing and development__: The computing and networking power behind IaaS make it a perfect place to run and manage testing and development cycles. With SLAs in place from providers and a high-level of security, enterprises can trust IaaS to run business-critical projects and get to market faster with a higher scalability of computing resources. IaaS enables teams to create test and development environments automatically, as part of their development pipeline.
5. __Networking services__: Because the network continues to grow in complexity, many are turning to IaaS service providers to deliver networking-as-a-service support. This may be for a short-term big data project, or to support ongoing initiatives, freeing up internal IT staff for other priorities. 
6. __HPC__: high-performance computing (HPC) can help solve complex and complex problems with millions of variables and calculations, by running them on supercomputers or large clusters of computers. The major IaaS providers offer services that place HPC within the reach of ordinary businesses, allowing them to use HPC on demand instead of making a huge investment in HPC infrastructure. For example, read our guide to HPC on Azure.

### Examples IaaS
1. AWS eg. EC2, S3, EBS(Elastic Block Store), Lambda, AWS FSx, 
2. Google Compute Engine (GCE),  
3. Oracle Cloud Infrastrure (OCI)
4. IBM SmartCloud 
5. Microsoft Azure
