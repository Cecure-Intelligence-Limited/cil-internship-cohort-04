Private, Public and Hybrid Cloud Architectures

A cloud infrastructure is offered in three methods: 
- Private hosting
- Public hosting
- Hybrid hosting. 

Each offers a varying amount of security, control, and management.

- Private: With a private cloud architecture, the service is done in-house and on-premise. Resources are shared internally among gated users for a high-level of control and security for sensitive data. This method is often better executed when a company is big enough to effectively operate its own cloud data center and has the budget to finance it. A private cloud makes sense, for example, if a companyâ€™s business revolves around an application and its data.

- Public: A public cloud architecture is a service provided, managed, and maintained off-site via the internet. This method can help streamline workflows and collaboration on applications with many users (email, for example), making sharing resources more efficient. However, there is a higher risk of vulnerability with a public offering. A public cloud makes sense, for example, if a company is working on an ad-hoc software development project with a PaaS offering.

- Hybrid: A hybrid cloud architecture includes a combination of private and public cloud offerings. This offering provides efficiency with a public cloud and security with a private cloud, but a company must manage numerous platforms at once while ensuring seamless API integration. A hybrid cloud makes the most sense, for example, if a company wants to enable a SaaS app while prioritizing security. Therefore, the SaaS provider would create a private cloud within its firewall.
