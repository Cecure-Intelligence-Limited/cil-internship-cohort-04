### IaaS
IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service offers the most in-house control, allowing access and direct maintenance to most cloud resources. IaaS is extensively automated and scalable, as clients are able to buy resources as-needed without relying on in-house hardware. With IaaS, the cloud services are mostly managed by a company, including applications, data, runtime, middleware, and operating systems. But the cloud vendor is responsible for the services, storage, networking, and virtualization.
Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a cloud computing service model in which computing resources are hosted in a public cloud, private cloud, or hybrid cloud. Businesses can use the IaaS model to shift some or all of their use of on-premises or collocated data center infrastructure to the cloud, where it is owned and managed by a cloud provider. These cost-effective infrastructure elements can include compute, network, and storage hardware as well as other components and software.
In the IaaS model, the cloud provider owns and operates the hardware and software and also owns or leases the data center. When you have an IaaS solution, you rent the resources like compute or storage, provision them when needed, and pay for the resources your organization consumes. For some resources such as compute, you’ll pay for the resources you use. For others such as storage, you’ll pay for capacity.
Infrastructure-as-a-service, or IaaS, is a step away from on-premises infrastructure. It’s a service where a third party provides you with infrastructure services, like storage and virtualization, as you need them, via a cloud, through the internet. 
As the user, you are responsible for the operating system and any data, applications, middleware, and runtimes, but a provider gives you access to, and management of, the network, servers, virtualization, and storage you need. 
You don’t have to maintain or update your own on-site datacenter because the provider does it for you. Instead, you access and control the infrastructure via an application programming interface (API) or dashboard. 
IaaS gives you flexibility to purchase only the components you need and scale them up or down as needed.

###### Benefits of IaaS
Higher availability: With IaaS a company can create redundant servers easily, and even create them in other geographies to ensure availability during local power outages or physical disasters.
Lower latency, improved performance. Because  IaaS providers typically operate data centers in multiple geographies, IaaS customers can locate apps and services closer to users to minimize latency and maximize performance.
Improved responsiveness. Customers can provision resources in a matter of minutes, test new ideas quickly and quickly roll out new ideas to more users.
Comprehensive security. With a high-level of security on-site, at data centers, and via encryption, organizations can often take advantage of more advanced security and protection they could provide if they hosted the cloud infrastructure in-house.
Faster access to best-of-breed technology. Cloud providers compete with each other by providing the latest technologies to their users, IaaS customers can take advantage of these technologies much earlier (and at far less cost) than they can implement them on premises.

###### IaaS use cases
###### Common uses of IaaS include: 
- Disaster recovery:  Instead of setting up redundant servers in multiple locations, IaaS can deploy its disaster recovery solution to the cloud provider's existing geographically-dispersed infrastructure.
- Ecommerce:  IaaS is an excellent option for online retailers that frequently see spikes in traffic. The ability to scale up during periods of high demand and high-quality security are essential in today’s 24-7 retail industry. 
- Internet of Things (IoT), event processing, artificial intelligence (AI): IaaS makes it easier to set up and scale up data storage and computing resources for these and other applications that work with huge volumes of data.
- Startups: Startups can't afford to sink capital into on-premises IT infrastructure. IaaS gives them access to enterprise-class data center capabilities without the up-front investment in hardware and management overhead.
- Software development: With IaaS, the infrastructure for testing and development environments can be set up much more quickly than on-premises. (However, this use case is better suited to PaaS, as you'll read in the next section.)


### PaaS
PaaS: Platform as a Service is somewhat comparable to SaaS, but instead offers a platform to create software. The PaaS method is delivered via the internet, giving IT teams the ability to design software without bothering with other aspects. With PaaS, the cloud vendor shoulders a majority of the service, including runtime, middleware, operating systems, servers, storage, networking, and virtualization. The company therefore only needs to worry about managing its applications and data.
PaaS (platform as a service)—not to be confused with SaaS (software as a service)—is a set of cloud services used to build and manage modern applications and data either on-premises or in the cloud. PaaS delivers infrastructure and middleware components in the cloud that enable developers and IT administrators to build and manage mobile apps and web applications.
To aid productivity, PaaS offers ready-to-use programming language components that enable the development of new capabilities within applications. These capabilities include innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), chatbots, blockchain, and the Internet of Things (IoT). In addition, PaaS also includes suites of application development tools, including cloud native services, Kubernetes, Docker and container engines, and more.

Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) is another step further from full, on-premise infrastructure management. It is where a provider hosts the hardware and software on its own infrastructure and delivers this platform to the user as an integrated solution, solution stack, or service through an internet connection.

Primarily useful for developers and programmers, PaaS allows the user to develop, run, and manage their own apps without having to build and maintain the infrastructure or platform usually associated with the process. 
You write the code, build, and manage your apps, but you do it without the headaches of software updates or hardware maintenance. The environment to build and deploy is provided for you. 
PaaS is a way that developers can create a framework to build and customize their web-based applications on. Developers can use built-in software components to create their applications, which cuts down on the amount of code they have to write themselves.

###### PaaS Samples:
-	AWS Elastic Beanstalk
-	Heroku
-	Red Hat OpenShift
-	Force.com
-	Google App Engine
-	Redhat OpenShift
-	Dokku


###### Benefits of PaaS
The primary benefit of PaaS  is that it allows customers to build, test, deploy run, update and scale applications more quickly and cost-effectively than they could if they had to build out and manage their own on-premises platform. Other benefits include:
- Faster time to market: PaaS enables development teams to spin-up development, testing and production environments in minutes, vs. weeks or months.
Low- to no-risk testing and adoption of new technologies: PaaS platforms typically include access to a wide range of the latest resources up and down the application stack. This allows companies to test new operating systems, languages, and other tools without having to make substantial investments in them, or in the infrastructure required to run them.
- Simplified collaboration: As a cloud-based service, PaaS provides a shared software development environment, giving development and operations teams access to all the tools they need, from anywhere with an Internet connection.
- A more scalable approach: With PaaS, organizations can purchase additional capacity for building, testing, staging and running applications whenever they need it.
Less to manage: PaaS  offloads infrastructure management, patches, updates and other administrative tasks to the cloud service provider. 

###### PaaS use cases
PaaS can advance a number of development and IT initiatives including:
- API development and management: With its built-in frameworks, PaaS makes it easier for teams to develop, run, manage and secure APIs for sharing data and functionality between applications. 
- Internet of Things (IoT):  PaaS supports a range of programming languages (Java, Python, Swift, etc.), tools and application environments used for IoT application development and real-time processing of data from IoT devices.
- Agile development and DevOps: PaaS solutions typically cover all the requirements of a DevOps toolchain, and provide built-in automation to support continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).
- Cloud-native development and hybrid cloud strategy: PaaS solutions support cloud-native development technologies - microservices, containers, Kubernetes, serverless computing - that enable developers to build once, then deploy and manage consistently across private cloud, public cloud and on-premises environments.


### SaaS

Software as a service (SaaS) is a cloud-based software delivery model in which the cloud provider develops and maintains cloud application software, provides automatic software updates, and makes software available to its customers via the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis. The public cloud provider manages all the hardware and traditional software, including middleware, application software, and security. So SaaS customers can dramatically lower costs; deploy, scale, and upgrade business solutions more quickly than maintaining on-premises systems and software; and predict total cost of ownership with greater accuracy.
Software-as-a-service (SaaS), also known as cloud application services, is the most comprehensive form of cloud computing services, delivering an entire application that is managed by a provider, via a web browser. 
Software updates, bug fixes, and general software maintenance are handled by the provider and the user connects to the app via a dashboard or API. There’s no installation of the software on individual machines and group access to the program is smoother and more reliable. 
SaaS: Software as a Service (aka cloud application services), is the most widely used type of cloud service. Popular for business as SaaS companies deliver strong customer experience through information exchange and services, SaaS takes a large part of the IT burden off the hands of a business. SaaS employs the internet to provide distributed applications and services, eliminating the need for clients to download any software. With SaaS, a cloud vendor fully manages the entire offering: applications, data, runtime, middleware, operating systems, services, storage, networking, and virtualization.

Software as a service is a very common cloud computing deliver model for business applications within an enterprise. SaaS offerings span all types of use case, including email and social collaboration, customer relationship management (CRM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), human resources management (HRM), and content management, just to name a few.
Through a SaaS model, data can be accessed from any device that has an internet connection and web browser. In the web-based method, a software vendor will host and maintain the servers, databases, and code that make up an application. This saves companies a tremendous amount of money since they no longer have to invest in expensive hardware to host the software. Additionally, instead of companies paying ongoing maintenance fees as well as a perpetual license, a SaaS model means they only pay an annual or monthly subscription fee, which includes the software license and support fees.

SaaS Samples:
-	Gmail
-	Google Calendar
-	Dropbox
-	Microsoft Outlook
-	Mailchimp

###### Benefits of SaaS
- The main benefit of SaaS is that it offloads all infrastructure and application management to the SaaS vendor. All the user has to do is create an account, pay the fee and start using the application. The vendor handles everything else, from maintaining the server hardware and software to managing user access and security, storing and managing data, implementing upgrades and patches and more.
Other benefits of SaaS include:
- Minimal risk: Many SaaS products offer a free trial period, or low monthly fees that let customers try the software to see if it will meet their needs, with little or no financial risk.
- Anytime/anywhere productivity: Users can work with SaaS apps on any device with a browser and an internet connection. 
- Easy scalability: Adding users is as simple as registering and paying for new seats; customers can purchase more data storage for a nominal charge.
Some SaaS vendors even enable customization of their product by providing a companion PaaS solution. One well-known example is Heroku, a PaaS solution for Salesforce. 

###### SaaS use cases
Today, just about any personal or employee productivity application is available as SaaS; specific use cases are too numerous to mention (some are listed above). If an end user or organization can find a SaaS solution with the required functionality, in most cases it will provide a significantly simpler, more scalable and more cost-effective alternative to on-premises software.
