## comparison on the different use cases for different kinds of databases

### There are following types of databases available;
- Relational database
- NoSQL database
- Centralised database
- Distributed database
- Personal database
- End-user database
- Commercial database
- Operational database
- Cloud database
- Object-oriented database
- Graph database


**Relational database**
This database is based on the relational data model, which stores data in the form of rows and columns  and together forms a table.
Each table in the database carries a key that makes the data unique from others. Examples of Relational databases are MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, etc.

**Relational database use cases**
- complex queries and reports.
- With SQL you can build one script that retrieves and presents your data. .
- High transaction application.
- Relational databases are a better fit for heavy duty or complex transactions because it’s more stable and ensure data integrity.
- When the data must be consisten without leaving room for error when using a relational database.

**NoSQL database**
This is a non-tabular database that uses different data models for storing, managing, and accessing data.
It is not a relational database as it stores data not only in tabular form but in several different ways.
The most common data models are:
- Document-oriented — to store, retrieve, and manage data as JSON documents;
- Key-value — to represent data as a collection of key-value pairs, where keys are unique strings having corresponding data values;
- Graph — to store data in the node-edge-node structure where nodes are data points and edges are their relationships; and
- Wide-column — to store data in the tabular format with flexible columns, meaning they can vary from row to row in the same table

**NoSQL database usecases**
- NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.
- When the datastructures we manage are variable.
- Event capture and processing
