## Describe the services Models and talsk about cases where ther are used. Give 5 examples each for the models

###  SaaS
SaaS or Software as a Service is a model that gives quick access to cloud-based web applications. The vendor controls the entire computing stack, which you can access using a web browser. These applications run on the cloud and you can use them by a paid licensed subscription or for free with limited access.

SaaS does not require any installations or downloads in your existing computing infrastructure. This eliminates the need for installing applications on each of your computers with the maintenance and support taken over by the vendor.  Some known examples of SaaS include Google G Suite, Microsoft Office 365, Dropbox, etc.

**Benefits**:
- Affordable – SaaS is affordable as it eliminates the costs involved in the purchase, installation, maintenance, and upgrades of computing hardware.
- Anywhere Accessibility – With SaaS, you can access the services from anywhere using any device such as smartphones, which eliminates the constraints set by on-premise software.
- Ready to Use – You can quickly set up SaaS services so that they become functional in no time. All it takes is that you sign up for the service to get access to fast and powerful computing resources.

**Use Case**: 
- An ideal choice for small-scale businesses that do not have the necessary budget and resources to deploy on on-premise hardware
- communication, transferring of content, and scheduling meetings

**Examples**:
- Microsoft Office 365
- Dropbox
- Cisco WebEx
- Tableau
- Slack


### IaaS
IaaS or Infrastructure as a Service is basically a virtual provision of computing resources over the cloud. An IaaS cloud provider can give you the entire range of computing infrastructures such as storage, servers, networking hardware alongside maintenance and support.

Businesses can opt for computing resources of their requirement without the need to install hardware on their premises.  Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Compute Engine are some of the leading IaaS cloud service provide

**Benefits**:
- Minimize Costs – Deploying an IaaS cloud model eliminates the need to deploy on-premise hardware that reduces the costs.
- Enhanced Scalability – As the most flexible cloud computing model, IaaS allows you to scale the computing resources up or down based on demand.
- Simple Deployment – IaaS lets you easily deploy the servers, processing, storage, and networking to make it up and running in no time.

**Use Cases**
- IT hardware infrastructure.
- High-performance computing
- Data warehousing and big data analytics
- Hosting Complex Websites

**Examples**:
- Amazon Web Service
- Google Compute Engine
- Rackspace
- Digital Ocean
- Microsoft Azure

### PaaS
Platform as a Service or PaaS is essentially a cloud base where you can develop, test, and organize the different applications for your business. Implementing PaaS simplifies the process of enterprise software development. The virtual runtime environment provided by PaaS gives a favorable space for developing and testing applications.

The entire resources offered in the form of servers, storage, and networking are manageable either by the company or a platform provider. Google App Engine and AWS Elastic Beanstalk are two typical examples of PaaS. PaaS is also subscription-based and gives you flexible pricing options depending on your business requirements.

**Benefits:**
- Minimal Development Time – PaaS reduces the development time since the vendor provides all computing resources like server-side components, which simplifies the process and improves the focus of the development team.
- Multiple Programming Language Support – PaaS offers support for multiple programming languages, which a software development company can utilize to build applications for different projects.
- Enhanced Collaboration – With PaaS, your business can benefit from having enhanced collaboration, which will help integrate your team dispersed across various locations.

**Use cases**
- API Development and Management
- Databases and Data Management
- Internet of Things

**Examples**:
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- Heroku
- Google App Engine
- Apache Stratos
- OpenShift
