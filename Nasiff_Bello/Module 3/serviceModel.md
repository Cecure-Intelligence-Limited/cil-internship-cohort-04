# Service Model 
## Introduction
Cloud computing is storing or accessing programs, apps, and data via the internet—instead of
directly on your computer hard drive. The most popular examples of cloud computing are Software
as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)—most of
which you can choose whether to set up in a public or private cloud option.

 **Public Cloud**
is cloud computing that’s delivered via the internet and shared across
organizations.

**Private Cloud**
is cloud computing that is dedicated solely to your organization.

In cloud computing, the cloud service provider owns, manages and maintains the assets depending on if the ; the customer 
consumes them via an Internet connection, and pays for them on a subscription or pay-as-you-go basis, 
they are so called 'As a service'. 'As a service' models refers to the way IT assets are consumed in these offerings.

# Service Models
If youʼre considering moving your ecommerce business to the Cloud, these are the three main types of cloud computing (not limited to three) different service models which each satisfy a unique set of business requirements.

## 1. ***IaaS, or Infrastructure as a Service*** 
IaaS Is on-demand access to cloud-hosted physical and virtual servers (virtualization), 
storage and networking - the backend IT infrastructure for running applications and workloads in the cloud.  

IaaS is beneficial to businesses of all shapes and sizes, as it allows complete control over your
infrastructure, and operates on a pay-as-you-use model, so it fits into most budgets.
As it becomes less common to invest in physical hardware and IT
infrastructure, choosing IaaS alternatives is a safer, more reliable
option.
With most IaaS platforms, you get access to ongoing support and have the option of scaling up your
requirements at any time.

## Use Cases
1. A good example of IaaS is AWS EC2.
EC2 provides scalable infrastructure for companies who want to host cloud-based applications.
EC2 users do not own the physical servers; AWS provides virtual servers.

2. Magento 1 Enterprise Edition can be either on-premise or IaaS depending on how the merchant chooses
to host their store.
In the case of IaaS, the merchant is paying Magento for the licensing of the software and then using a
third party vendor for the best web hosting such as Rackspace.
Merchants are able to pay for a hosting plan that meets their own needs without the cost of maintaining
their own physical servers.
The merchant is still responsible for installing and managing updates to their Magento software.

## Examples
- AWS EC2 
- Rackspace 
- Google Compute Engine (GCE)
- Digital Ocean
- Magento 1 Enterprise Edition.

## IaaS Advantages:
Maintaining on-premise IT infrastructure is costly and labor-intensive.
 It often requires a significant initial investment in physical hardware, and then you will probably need to
engage external IT contractors to maintain the hardware and keep everything working and up-to-date.

With IaaS:
- Minimize Costs – Deploying an IaaS cloud model eliminates the need to deploy on-premise hardware that reduces the costs.
- Enhanced Scalability – As the most flexible cloud computing model, IaaS allows you to scale the computing resources up or down based on demand.
- Simple Deployment – IaaS lets you easily deploy the servers, processing, storage, and networking to make it up and running in no time.

All this without needing external IT contractors to do.

## IaaS Characteristics:
IaaS platforms are:
- Highly flexible and highly scalable.
- Accessible by multiple users.
- Cost-effective.

## Things to Consider Before IaaS Implementation
1. Clearly define your access needs and the bandwidth of your network to facilitate smooth implementation and function.
2. Plan out thorough data storage and security strategy to streamline the process.
3. Ensure a disaster recovery plan so that your data remains safe and accessible at all means.

## 2. ***PaaS, or Platform as a Service*** 
Is on-demand access to a complete, ready-to-use, cloud-hosted platform for 
developing, running, maintaining and managing applications. It offers the runtime environment for applications over the internet.

PaaS is often the most cost-effective and time-effective way for a developer to create a unique
application.
PaaS allows the developer to focus on the creative side of app development, as opposed to menial tasks
such as managing software updates or security patches. All of their time and brainpower will go into
creating, testing, and deploying the app.

## Use Cases
1. A good example of PaaS is AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
Amazon Web Services (AWS) o􀁸ers over 100 cloud computing services such as EC2, RDS, and S3.
Most of these services can be used as IaaS, and most companies who use AWS will pick and choose the
services they need.
However, managing multiple di􀁸erent services can quickly become difficult and time-consuming for
users.
Thatʼs where AWS Elastic Beanstalk comes in: it works as another layer
on top of the infrastructure services and automatically handles the
details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and
application health monitoring.

All you need to do is upload and maintain your application

2. Magento Commerce Cloud (also known as Magento Enterprise Cloud Edition) is the most common
example of PaaS for ecommerce.
This enables the merchant to bundle their hosting as part of their package with Magento.
Merchants evaluating Magento go through a scoping process to determine their hosting needs which is
then bundled into their monthly plan.
Merchants still have full access to edit the source code of their Magento store and can fully customize the
application.

Any platform updates, security patches and general maintenance to
their store would be the responsibility of the merchant.

## Examples 
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk 
- Heroku 
- Windows Azure (mostly used as PaaS)
- Force.com
- OpenShift
- Apache Stratos
- Magento Commerce Cloud.

## PaaS Advantages:
PaaS is primarily used by developers who are building software or applications.
- Minimal Development Time – PaaS reduces the development time since the vendor provides all computing resources like server-side components, which simplifies the process and improves the focus of the development team.
- Multiple Programming Language Support – PaaS offers support for multiple programming languages, which a software development company can utilize to build applications for different projects.
- Enhanced Collaboration – With PaaS, your business can benefit from having enhanced collaboration, which will help integrate your team dispersed across various locations.

## PaaS Characteristics:
PaaS platforms are:
- Accessible by multiple users.
- Scalable – you can choose from various tiers of resources to suit the size of your business.
- Built on virtualization technology.
- Easy to run without extensive system administration knowledge.

## Things to Consider Before PaaS Implementation
1. Crucially analyzing your business needs, decide the automation levels, if it needs to be self-service or fully automated.
2. Clearly determine whether to deploy on a private or public cloud.
3. Plan through the customization, and efficiency levels.

## 3. ***SaaS, or software as a service*** 
Is on-demand access to ready-to-use, cloud-hosted application software available via a third-party over the internet. 

SaaS platforms are ideal for when you want an application to run
smoothly and reliably with minimal input from you.


## Use Cases
1. Take your email server, for example.
You want to know that youʼll continue to send and receive emails without needing to fiddle with your
email settings or worry about updates.
Imagine if your email server went under because you forgot to update it and you went days without
email? Thatʼs simply not an option in todayʼs marketplace.
If you use a SaaS platform to run your email inbox, the chances of something going wrong are very
small.
And if something did go wrong, it would be up to the SaaS provider to find a solution.

Youʼre not only paying for the SaaS applications/products: youʼre
paying for peace of mind.

2. BigCommerce is an example of a SaaS ecommerce platform.
BigCommerce provides complete shopping cart software, as well as
hosting infrastructure to the user, allowing businesses to create an
online shop within minutes without worrying about coding, hosting, or
software.

The BigCommerce platform also has regular updates that automatically roll out for users, and all the
so􀁹ware licenses, upgrades, and hosting costs are covered in the monthly subscription fee.

## Examples of SaaS 
**SaaS examples:** 
- BigCommerce
- Google Apps
- Salesforce
- Dropbox
- MailChimp
- ZenDesk
- DocuSign
- Slack 
- Hubspot.

## SaaS Advantages:
- Affordable – SaaS is affordable as it eliminates the costs involved in the purchase, installation, maintenance, and upgrades of computing hardware.
- Anywhere Accessibility – With SaaS, you can access the services from anywhere using any device such as smartphones, which eliminates the constraints set by on-premise software.
- Ready to Use – You can quickly set up SaaS services so that they become functional in no time. All it takes is that you sign up for the service to get access to fast and powerful computing resources.
## SaaS Characteristics:
SaaS platforms are:
- Available over the internet.
- Hosted on a remote server by a third-party provider.
- Scalable, with di􀁸erent tiers for small, medium, and enterprise-level businesses.
- Inclusive, o􀁸ering security, compliance, and maintenance as part of the cost.

## Things to Consider Before SaaS Implementation
1. Opt for configuration over customization within a SaaS-based delivery model. The configuration will allow you to tailor without changing the core product, whereas, customization will make it challenging to scale with the constant updates and documentation.
2. Understand the adoption and usage rates carefully, and set clear objectives to be achieved with the SaaS adoption.
3. Compliment your SaaS solution with integrations, and security options to make it more user-initiated.


# Categories of Various Computing Services to Cloud Computing Models
| Computing Services | Cloud Computing Models|  |  |
|--------------------| -----------------------| --- | --- |
|					 | SaaS   | PaaS   | IaaS |	
| Applications | Provide | Don't Provide | Don't Provide|
|Data | Provide | Don't Provide | Don't Provide|
|Runtime | Provide | Provide | Dont't Provide |
| Middleware | Provide | Provide | Don't Provide|
| OS | Provide | Provide | Provide|
| Virtualization | Provide | Provide | Provide |
| Servers| Provide | Provide |  Provide |
| Storage | Provide | Provide | Provide |
| Networking | Provide | Provide | Provide |

## NB: 
- ***provide*** here, the cloud services providers of the 'As a Service' model owns, manages, and maintains the assets while the customer consumes them via the internet as mentioned earlier.
- ***Don't provide*** here, the consumer of the 'As a service' model, owns, manually configure, manages, maintains and operates the assets.

# Conclusion 

Each of these cloud computing server models give users choice,
flexibility, and options that on-premise hosting simply cannot provide.
Some cloud computing server models are more complicated than others.
The level of system administration knowledge decreases as you go down the list in this order: On premise > IaaS > PaaS > SaaS.

You might choose to start with one cloud computing service model or find a need for all three: that
depends on the size and complexity of your business.
