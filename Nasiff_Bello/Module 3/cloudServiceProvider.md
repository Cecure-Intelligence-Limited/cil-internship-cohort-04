# Cloud Service Provider
## **Introduction**
Cloud computing is storing or accessing programs, apps, and data via the internet—instead of
directly on your computer hard drive. The most popular examples of cloud computing are Software
as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)—most of
which many companys today are specificaly set up to provide.

Whether it’s infrastructure, software, applications, services, products, or even an operating system, everything is making its way to the cloud. 
As a result, billions of dollars are being invested in cloud migration. 
I will talk about the most popular cloud providers and their cloud offerings. 

## **Service Providers**

Today the cloud computing services have replaced search hard drive technology and came with a new concept called cloud technology in which the data store in the cloud. 
There are many companies which provide Cloud computing service and they are very reliable.

These are the service, which offers by Cloud Computing Providers:

***IaaS, or Infrastructure as a Service,*** is on-demand access to cloud-hosted physical and virtual servers, storage and networking - the backend IT infrastructure for running applications and workloads in the cloud.

***PaaS, or Platform as a Service,*** is on-demand access to a complete, ready-to-use, cloud-hosted platform for developing, running, maintaining and managing applications.It offers the runtime environment for applications.
