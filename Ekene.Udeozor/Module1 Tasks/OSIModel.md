A layered process similar to the OSI model is the TCP / IP model.
TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol.
IP stands for Internet Protocol.
The TCP / IP protocol combines the application, presentation and session layers of the OSI model into a single application layer.
The data link and physical layers of the OSI model are also combined to create a single network interface layer in the TCP / IP model.
The TCP / IP model has 4 layers: application, transport, internet and network interface unlike the OSI model which has 7 layers.

The application layer provides applications such as internet browsers with standardized data exchange. It's protocols include HTTP, FTP, Post Office Protocol 3, Simple Mail Transfer Protocol and Simple Network Management Protocol.

The transport layer is responsible for maintaining end-to-end communications across the network. TCP handles communications between hosts and provides flow control, multiplexing and reliability. The transport protocols include TCP and User Datagram Protocol (UDP), which is sometimes used instead of TCP for special purposes such as streaming because it is faster than TCP as it is a connectionless protocol.

The internet layer, also called the network layer, deals with packets and connects independent networks to transport the packets across network boundaries. The network layer protocols are IP and Internet Control Message Protocol, which is used for error reporting.

The network interface layer, also known as the physical layer or data link layer, consists of protocols that operate only on a link, the network component that interconnects nodes or hosts in the network. The protocols in this lowest layer include Ethernet for local area networks and Address Resolution Protocol.
