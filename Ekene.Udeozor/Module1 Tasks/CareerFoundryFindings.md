# FINDINGS FROM CAREER FOUNDRY'S UX DESIGN FOR BEGINNERS

* The name user experience was coined by Don Norman in the 1990s.
* UX is the overall experience a user has when interacting with a product or service.
* In the words of Don Norman, "UX encompasses all aspects of a person's experience with a system, form the materials used to the interaction itself (physical or digital), along with the interface, graphics and orientation."
* UX designers typically interview prospective users, create wireframes and build prototypes.
* The UX design process consists of: research, design, testing and implementation.
* UX designers perform user research which ranges from conducting analysis of competitors to interviewing prospective users to find out what they want the product to solve, what features they are looking for and what in what context they would use the product.
* UX designers create personas (fictional users created from real user data) and figure out what these users would want.
* Products and services are tested throughout the design process. User testing helps to catch any major design flaws before going into the development phase. This saves the company time and resources.
* Usabilty testing is the most common type of user testing.
* The golden rule of UX is to design with the user in mind.
* Affinity mapping is a UX research analysis technique in which research observations are written on post-it notes, grouped into similar clusters and placed on a wall or whiteboard.
* UX designers work closely with developers to identify any design elements that might be tricky to implement from a technical perspective.

* There are 4 quadrants of UX design: Experience strategy, interaction design, information architecture and user research.
* Experience strategy is all about making sure everyone is serving the right users while simultaneously aligning with the strategic goals of business.
Information architecture is the science of organizing and structuring content in a logical, user-friendly way.
Information design focuses on how a user interacts specific elements of a digital product. It answers questions like "What happens when a user clicks a button?" or "How will the user transition between different pages on a mobile app?".
