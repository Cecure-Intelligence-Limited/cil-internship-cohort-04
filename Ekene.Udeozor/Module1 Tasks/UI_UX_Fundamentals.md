# FUNDAMENTALS OF UI/UX

UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) design are two terms that are often placed and used together and
from the surface may seem to be describing the same thing.
UI and UX are essentially two sides of the same coin. While user interface design deals with how something looks
and how we interact with it, user experience design deals with how something works.

# USER INTERFACE DESIGN
A term coined by Joel Spolsky in 1995, the goal of UI design is to make the user's interaction as simple and efficient
as possible.
It is the process of creating products that are easy to use, by thinking about the user's needs and how they will interact with the product.
UI design encompasses everything from buttons and icons to drop-down menus and sliders to text and images and how all these components can
be combined to create interactive interfaces that are both aesthetically appealing and functional.

A good UI design can make your customer base just as well as a bad UI design can break it.
The most obvious reason for investing in UI design is for business reasons: if you want people to buy from you, you app or website, you have to ensure they are not frustrated and leave before they convert.
A good UI design is very essential to a good user experience but they are not the same thing.

# USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN
The term user experience (UX) design was coined by Don Norman in the 1990s.
It is the difference between a website that people love to visit and one they can't to leave.
User experience (UX) design is the process design teams use to create products that provide meaningful and relevant experiences to users.
It consists of traditional elements of design and engineering integrated with scientific disciplines such as psychology, sociology and anthropology. UX designers are responsible for the overall feel of a product or service.
Customers who have a good user experience with a product or service are likely to return while those who have a bad experience will have negative reviews and share with others. For this reason, the role of UX in a business cannot be overstated.

# CONCLUSION

From the perspective of a user, there is no difference between UI and UX. The experience is what you feel and think when you interact with a product or service.
There is no difference between the quality of your experience whether you are interacting with a web page or an app, whether you are using a desktop computer or your mobile phone.

From the perspective of a designer, there is a big difference. They are two completely different fields of study. While they share some common interests, they donâ€™t overlap.
